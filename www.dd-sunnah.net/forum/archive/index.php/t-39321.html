The Ten Things You Canít Say in America by Larry Elder<br />
<br />
Published in The Freeman: Ideas on Liberty - October 2001<br />
<br />
 Printable Format  <br />

<br />
There is hope yet for America. Larry Elder is a host of a successful talk show on KABC Radio in Los Angeles and a nationally syndicated columnist who wins the imprimatur of a major book publisher to carry a big message. As a black libertarian, he is also a breath of fresh air in his courage and plain speaking. <br />
<br />
Elder is even something of a firebrand. Here he daringly takes on the Fortress America of Political Correctness on and off the campus, in and out of the mainline media, from and to the church pulpit. And so he assails ten supposedly unassailable yet monumentally politically correct paradigms. <br />
<br />
Here are his topics: <br />
l. Blacks Are More Racist than Whites; <br />
2. White Condescension Is as Bad as Black Racism; <br />
3. The Media Bias: Itís Real, Itís Widespread, Itís Destructive; <br />
4. The Glass CeilingóFull of Holes; <br />
5. Americaís Greatest Problem: Not Crime, Racism, or Bad SchoolsóItís Illegitimacy; <br />
6. There Is No Health-Care ìCrisisî; <br />
7. Americaís Welfare State: The Tyranny of the Statist Quo; <br />
8. Republicans Versus Democrats: Maybe a Dimeís Worth of Difference; <br />
9. The War Against Drugs Is Vietnam II: Weíre Losing This One, Too; <br />
10. Gun Control Advocates: Good Guys with Blood on Their Hands. <br />
<br />
Those are indeed things that canít be said in most circles, but Elder argues his points with great assurance. He says out loud what Americans only whisper at the kitchen table, on the shop floor, or at the water cooler. Something has gone wrong. <br />
<br />
We have become, he maintains, a nation of whimpering people who wonít take responsibility for our own actions, but furiously rage that the problem is always someone or something else. <br />
<br />
Hereís a choice cut of Elderís rhetoric: ìWeíve become a nation of ëvicticratsí. . . . The glass ceiling? Nonsense. Hate crimes? All crimes are hateful. O.J. Simpson? He did it, and his defense team shamelessly used the black victicrat mentality to escape conviction.î <br />
<br />
Letís focus on just two of his ìten things.î First, take his argument that the War On Drugs amounts to Vietnam IIóthat weíre mired in a bloody and foolish conflict that canít be won. <br />
Why, he asks, is it all right for his next-door neighbor to come home and have a martinióbut a serious criminal offense to come home and smoke a joint? <br />
<br />
Drugs, he admits, can kill, but so can alcohol. And so does tobacco, in far larger numbers. Ditto for overeating. The moral question is who is accountable to whom? Who should take responsibilityóthe individual or the Nanny State? Elder, of course, canít abide the latter. <br />
<br />
Second, what about those ìholier than thouî gun controllers? For all their talk about child safety locks and ìsensibleî gun registration and licensing requirements, Elder asks if their ultimate aim isnít the confiscation of privately owned weapons. <br />
<br />
Bare fists or mace wonít do when an attacker has a gun. Elder believes you have the right to decide what sort of personal defense to own and use while the controllers think they are entitled to make that choice for you. He notes that New York has issued concealed weapons permits to Donald Trump, Laurence Rockefeller, and Howard Stern. Well, what about the baker in Queens? Or for that matter, women anywhere who are worried about violence? <br />
<br />
Books by talk-show hosts tend to be unscholarly, but not this one. Elder has done his homework. Ten Things You Canít Say in America is heavily documented, with many graphs and tables. <br />
<br />
Larry Elderís book is a triumph of common sense, with enough nerve to shake up the dreary statist quo. It is a passionate plea for limited government and personal responsibility. Let us hope to hear more from him. <br />
