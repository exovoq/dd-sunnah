<br />
for your question ensha allah i'll answer u and i hope that i give u the full  information about your question <br />
<br />
The religion of the Shiah was founded by a Jew from Yemen called Abdullah bin Saba'. This religion has started with the assassination of the rightly guided Khalifa Uthman and branched into many sections<br />
<br />
Sunnis recognize that Abdullah bin Sabaí really exists, while Shiíi deny his existence. Shiíis deny the existence of Abdullah bin Sabaí because there are some abscure facts about him<br />
<br />
he is ahypocrite <br />
<br />
simply <br />
<br />
as u see in this equation <br />
<br />
taqqiah ( lying ) + Abdullah bin Saba ---------&gt; sheas start to apear <br />
<br />
this is achemistry lesson or what :D<br />
<br />
welcome again :)</div></div><hr />

Thank you sister in Islam for your explanation.  I have heard about tooqia and read about it in some books about the raafidha in English. Sometimes I hear other stories, but just from friends.  This Abdullah bin Saba seems interesting, because Saul (later Paul) was a Jew who corrupted the beliefs of the Christians with so much shirk in his new testament writings.  By the way, I would like to know more about the story of Abdullah bin Saba.  Is it true that he intercepted a letter bound for Egypt and changed the words and this is why one of the khulafa alrashideen was killed?<br />
Thank you,<br />
wasalaam</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StraightPath</div><div class="date">11-07-03, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well said bro AmericanMuslim, Abdallah Bin Saba' pretty much tried to be the &quot;Paul&quot; or &quot;Saul&quot; of Islam, but alhamdulillah Allah had protected his religion with great men who dealt with the sciences of hadeeth and authentication.<br />
Abdallah Bin Saba',the Jewish hypocrite who hid kufr and showed Islam, was the first to give Ali raa god-like attributes, and this is even in their &quot;authentic&quot; books.<br />
Even though they may deny his existance, he is mentioned in their most authentic books, actually the &quot;founder&quot; of their sciences of hadeeth ( who took ideas from Ibn Assalah and others from the sunnah on rules and standards and classification of hadeeths etc , but didnt stick to them because that would make all of their hadeeths not accepted ) , had chains of narrators going back to Abdallah Bin Saba'! so they really have to deal with it, either by saying their greatest scholars arent qualified to be so, or are liars or whatever, or by accepting this fact, both ways it destorys the foundation of their religion.<br />
Bros in the Arabic section wrote lengthy articles on this, hopefully they will be translated soon insha'Allah.<br />
Welcome to the board bro</div></div><hr />
