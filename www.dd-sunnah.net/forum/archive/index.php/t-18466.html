<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">«·„—”«·</div><div class="date">09-08-03, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All praise is due to Allah,we praise Him, seek His Help and forgiveness; we repent to Him and seek refuge in Allah from the evils of our own slaves and from our wicked deeds . Whomsoever has been guided by Allaah , non can misguided and whomsoever has been misguided by Allaah non can guide him. I bear witness that there is no true god worthy or being worshipped except Allaah alone, without a partner or associate. I further bare witness that Mohammed (Salla Allaah Aleihi Waslan1 )<br />
<br />
 is Allaah true slave and Messenger ; may Allaah bestow His peace and Blessings on Muhammed (Salla Allaah Aleihi Wasallam) <br />
<br />
, upon his good and pure family , and upon his noble companions and those who follow their path.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
It proceeds then: that the knowledge about Tawheed2 constitutes the most noble and necessitated knowledge, because it represents the knowledge about Allah , His right upon His bondsmen . This knowledge is the key for the way to Allaah , and it is the foundation for His legislation. That is why there is a consensus amongst all the messengers to invite people to Tawheed . Allaah  ⁄«·Ï3 says:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
( Ê „« √—”·‰« „‰ ﬁ»·ﬂ „‰ —”Ê· ≈·« ‰ÊÕÏ ≈·ÌÂ √‰Â ·« ≈·Â ≈·« √‰« ›√⁄»œÊ‰)<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
And we did not send any Messenger before you (O Mohammed) but We inspired him (saying(: Lailaha illa Ana {none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allah)},so worship Me (alone and no one else).( Quríaan 21:25(4 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Alaahh bears witness on His Wahdaniyyah: being the only true God that deserves to be worshipped alone and who has no coequal in Himself as well as in His Names and Attributes .The angles and people of knowledge also testify for His Wahdaniyyah :<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
( ‘Âœ «··Â √‰Â ·« ≈·Â ≈·« ÂÊ Ê «·„·«∆ﬂ… Ê √Ê·Ê «·⁄·„ ﬁ«∆„« »«·ﬁ”ÿ ·« ≈·Â ≈·« ÂÊ «·⁄“Ì“ «·ÕﬂÌ„) ( ¬· ⁄„—«‰ °18)<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Allaah bears witness that La illah illa Huwah ( none has Wright to worshiped but He,) and the angles , and those having knowledge (also give this witness); ( He is always) maintaining His creation in Justice . La illah illa Huwa , the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.(Quraían 3:18)<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Given this acknowledgement of the rank of Taweed, it is therefore incumbent upon every Muslim to give proper consideration to this matter through learning, understanding, education, and conviction, in order for him to establish his Deen 5on a sound foundation, confidence and submission that would give him the good fortune of sharing itís fruits and results.<br />

1 Salla Allaah Aleihi Wasallam1 : The Salaah and Salaam of Allaah be upon his prophet Mohammed . The Salaah of Allaah upon his prophet Mohammed is His praise of the prophet to the angles who are close to (but below) to Allaah , the most high , who arose abode His ëArsh ( Throne) which is above the seven skies. The angles also praise himî Salla Allaah Aleihi Wasallamî The Salaam is Allaahís safeguard and of the prophet from the deficiencies and kind of evils . When the Muslim saysî Salla Allaah Aleihi Wasallamî , they invokes Allaah to grant His praise and security to the prophet Mohammed .See Ibnul Alqyyaimís Jalaa ëul Afhaam, p.128. Published by Daar Ibn Katheer , Damascus, and Maktabat Daat At-Turaath, Al-Madeenah , 1409H/1988.<br />

2 Tawheed 2 is maintaining the belief that Allaah is the only true God worthy of worship and that He is the true and only Rabb of every thing and that He is unique in His Divine Names,Attributes and Actions.(TN)<br />

  ⁄«·Ï3   : Taíaalaa : Supremely Exalted id He. He is Exalted in His Thaat (Essence) and in <br />
<br />
His Attributes. (TN)<br />

5 Deen : Is more comprehensive in itís meaning than the western concept of ìreligionî . Every aspect of life subscribes to the revelation from Allaah. Therefore, Deen covers life in all of its various stages and complexities. (TN)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Allah Talaa says in surah Alnisaa ayah ( 136 ) .. &quot; O ye who believe! believe in Allah and His Messenger and the ************************ure which He hath sent to His Messenger and the ************************ure which He sent to those before (him). Any who denieth Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Day of Judgment, hath gone far, far astray. &quot;<br />
<br />
Allah did not describe any one without Immamh as astray.. :rolleyes: poor creed<br />
