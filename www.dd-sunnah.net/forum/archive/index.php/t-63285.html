Is that true ? Let's quote words of Emam Ali on the caliphs Abu Bakr, Umar, Othman -ra-, then you reader can judge if u got a mind of course. Please Keep your heart open to reason and read the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
Sermon No. 146<br />
Spoken when `Umar ibn al-Khattab consulted Amir al-mu'minin about taking part in the battle of Persia<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In this matter, victory of defeat is not dependent on the smallness or greatness of forces. It is Allah's religion which He has raised above all faiths, and His army which He has mobilised and extended, till it has reached the point where it stands now, and has arrived its present positions. We hold a promise from Allah, and He will fulfil His promise and support His army. <br />
The position of the head of government is that of the thread for beads, as it connects them and keeps them together. If the thread is broken, they will disperse and be lost, and will never come together again. The Arabs today, even though small in number are big because of Islam and strong because of unity. You should remain like the axis for them, and rotate the mill (of government) with (the help of) the Arabs, and be their root. Avoid battle, because if you leave this place the Arabs will attack you from all sides and directions till the unguarded places left behind by you will become more important than those before you. <br />
If the Persians see you tomorrow they will say, &quot;He is the root (chief) of Arabia. If we do away with him we will be in peace.&quot; In this way this will heighten their eagerness against you and their keenness to aim at you. You say that they have set out to fight against the Muslims. Well, Allah detests their setting out more than you do, and He is more capable of preventing what He detests. As regards your idea about their (large) number, in the past we did not fight on the strength of large numbers but we fought on the basis of Allah's support and assistance.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Imagine Emam Ali advising Umar Ibn Al khatab to stay at the backside of the army. The question<br />
Is if Emam Ali hates Umar he would give him the wrong advise isnítí it <br />
<br />
<br />
Sermon No. 134<br />
<br />
Delivered when Caliph `Umar ibn al-Khattab consulted  Amir al-mu'minin about himself, taking part in the march towards Rome ( Byzantine Empire ).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Allah has taken upon Himself for the followers of this religion the strengthening of boundaries and hiding of the secret places. Allah helped them when they were few and could not protect themselves. He is living and will not die. If you will your self proceed towards the enemy and clash with them and fall into some trouble, there will be no place of refuge for the Muslims other than their remote cities, nor any place they would return to. Therefore, you should send there an experienced man and send with him people of good performance who are well-intentioned. If Allah grants you victory, then this is what you want. If it is otherwise, you would serve as a support for the people and a returning place for the Muslims.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Emam Ali advising Umar Ibn Al Khatab to send an experienced man in his place, to avoid his death and obviously collapse of Islamic state for once !<br />
Now shiaa are cursing Umar Ibn Al Khatab ! How far are they from Emam Ali !! How insane !!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
letter to Mu'awiya No.6<br />
<br />
Verily, those who took the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman have sworn allegiance to me. Now those who were present at the election have no right to go back against their oaths of allegiance and those who were not present on the occasion have no right to oppose me. And so far as Shura (limited franchise or selection) was concerned it was supposed to be limited to Muhajirs and Ansars and it was also supposed that whomsoever they selected, became caliph as per approval and pleasure of Allah. If somebody goes against such decision, then he should be persuaded to adopt the course followed by others, and if he refuses to fall in line with others, then war is the only course left open to be adopted against him and as he has refused to follow the course followed by the Muslims, Allah will let him wander in the wilderness of his ignorance and schism. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How strong is this testimony of Emam Ali on Caliphs before him !! Only a blind man would ignore such clear fact!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sermon 228<br />
<br />
About a companion who passed away from this world before the occurrence of troubles<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
May Allah reward such and such man  who straightened the curve, cured the disease, abandoned mischief and established the sunnah. He departed (from this world) with untarnished clothes and little shortcomings. He achieved good (of this world) and remained safe from its evils. He offered Allah's obedience and feared Him as He deserved. He went away and left the people in dividing ways wherein the misled cannot obtain guidance and the guided cannot attain certainty.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The word ësuch maní refers to the Caliph Umar Ibn Al Khatab as explained by the famous interpreter of Nahl Al Balagha a scholar named Abu Al Hadeed who said ìIíve read from a copy with the handwriting of  Al Reda Abu Al hasan that the name ëUmarí was written below the word ësuch maníí.<br />
We can simply ask whoís that so important man whom Emam Ali refers to ? It is obvious that the narrator has omitted the name of Umar intentionally since it opposes his dogmatic belief! <br />
<br />
These are words which translates the attitudes of Emam Ali towards Abu Bakr, Umar, and Othman, then whatís wrong with you followers of Emam Ali ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have to thank brother Abu Saleh from whom I translated the quotes from Nahj Al Balagha</div></div><hr />
