&quot;Our Bible reveals to us the character of our god with minute and remorseless exactness. ... It is perhaps the most damnatory biography that exists in print anywhere. It makes Nero an angel of light and leading by contrast. ...&quot; <br />
- Mark Twain, &quot;Reflections on Religion&quot; (1906)<br />
&quot;No actual tyrant known to history has ever been guilty of one-hundredth of the crimes, massacres, and other atrocities attributed to the Deity in the Bible. ...&quot;<br />

Ban The Bible<br />
<br />
There are no better porn writers than the authors of the Bible. Consider the unbridled eroticism of the Song of Solomon. Or if you want hardcore smut, incest, rape, sexual mutilation, voyeurism, watersports, fornication, adultery, etc., look no further than your family Bible. <br />
Christians justify the sex therein as &quot;contextualized&quot; with a &quot;moral message.&quot; Wrapping porn in a morality tale is the oldest ploy of smut peddlers. No one reads the endings anyway, but including a moral message salves the conscience of the pious. It's one way to have your..., shall we say &quot;cake,&quot; and eat it, too. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt. For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.&quot; (Ezekiel 23: 19-21) <br />
&quot;and lusted after her paramours there, whose members were like those of donkeys, and whose emission was like that of stallions.&quot; (Ezekiel 23: 21, NRSV)<br />
<br />
Although this uplifting tale of the whores, Aholah and Aholibah gives a much needed moral lesson against the sins of the flesh, why does God have to describe their adventures in such pornographic detail? Is God a lover of porn? <br />
Would any parents want their children to compare the size of men's penises to donkey genitals and the sperm flow to that of horse issues? Apart from giving their daughters false expectations, think of the harm it will do to a young boy's self esteem, it also leads to the question: <br />
<br />
Why Do Christians Want To Pervert Our Children?<br />
<br />
Sex, violence, hatred, racism, degredation of women, filth, intolerence and gross excesses, permeate our society. It can be found in our towns and cities, our schools and libraries, our homes and churches.<br />
<br />
Although religious parents have no problem blaming secular sources in corrupting children they have a blind spot when in comes to that most corrupting of influences ~ their beloved bible.<br />
<br />
How can expect to live in a fine, moral nation unless this book, which has polluted the minds of children for generations, is banned?<br />
<br />
Think of the considerable effort expended into banning books such as The Diary of Anne Frank, To Kill A Mockingbird, The Color Purple, Huckleberry Finn, the Harry Potter series and The Origin Of The Species for their subject matter. The fine Christian tradition of book burning, with so many books rightfully burned or banned for their violence, murder, cruelty or for containing dangerous thoughts or ideas ~ all things we must keep from youthful eyes, should and must be extended to the bible.<br />
<br />
And yet the Bible, full of the very same demented activity, has yet to be exposed.<br />
<br />
Many children are taught to believe in the &quot;good book&quot; before they even think logically. Parents read them bedtime stories from it's dangerous and damaging ****************************s. They must know that the &quot;holy&quot; book, used in churches and Sunday school classes around the world, includes some of the worst examples of sex, filth, incest, perversion and violence in print.<br />
<br />
It's very sad but it's also very true and I'm sure that decent, thoughtful parents are amazed that such a source of indecent and decedent negative influence on our children has been overlooked for so many years.<br />
<br />
From an early age far too many children are are exposed to this book, or it is left where innocent children can easily find it. Their impressionable minds are corrupted and their fragile lives ruined by being exposed to the it's grotesque and perverse ****************************s.<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Before we get to the smut and filth, consider what we find just a few pages into Genesis:<br />
<br />
2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.<br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone knows that Adam lived for 900 years yet here we have the bible writers calling God a liar ~ God said for in the day that thou eatest ~ and not keeping His word about killing someone.<br />
<br />
But it gets worse after a few more verses:<br />
<br />
And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.&quot; (Genesis 4:17)<br />
Here we have a clear case of incest because at that time the entire human population of the earth consisted of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, so the only possibility is that his mother, Eve, served as his wife.<br />
<br />
Cain killed his brother and rather than punishing him for murdering a quarter of the world population, God protected him by setting &quot;a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.&quot; (verse 14).<br />
<br />
So, within the first few chapters of &quot;The Good Book&quot; we see disobedience being rewarded, incest being condoned and a murderer being protected. What sort of twisted morality could possible believe that our children should exposed to such ideas?<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Anyway, on with the filth.<br />
Why would anyone other than a pervert wish us to expose our children to such disgusting activities and dispicable practices as blatant sexuality, lust, nudity, covetousness, forced sex and illegitimate pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Those who promote the bible as morally uplifting should follow the advice given by Saint Matthew and castrate themselves. It would certainly help to get their perverted minds off sex:<br />
<br />
But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given. For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs from the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it. (Matthew 19:11-12)<br />
The Bible Encourages Exhibitionism, Incest, Flashing, Frivolous sex, Blatant Lust, Prostitution, Rape and Human Dismemberment<br />
David Flashes For His Maids:<br />
<br />
&quot;Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!&quot; II Samuel 6:20<br />
God Exposes Ninever's Naughty Bits:<br />
<br />
&quot;Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame. I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make the vile, and will set thee as gazingstock.&quot; Nahum 3:5<br />
<br />
Exhibitionism And Public Sexual Intercourse<br />
&quot;Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of the sun. For thou didst it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.&quot; II Samuel 12:11,12<br />
<br />
&quot;And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house, and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father.....so they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.&quot; II Samuel 16:21,22<br />
Forced Sexual Slavery<br />
&quot;How shall we do for wives for them that remain?..... And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the woman and the children. And this is the thing that ye shall do. Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man. And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying by any male; and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead.&quot; Judges 21:7,12<br />
&quot;Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth, as a long hind and a graceful doe, let her breasts satisfy you at all times.&quot; Proverbs 5:18-19<br />
<br />
&quot;Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters. I said, 'I will climb the palm tree. I will take hold of its fruit stalks.' Oh may your breasts be like clusters of the vine and the fragrance of your breath like apples.&quot; Song of Solomon 7:7-8<br />
Blatant sexuality.<br />
Solomon, one of the &quot;heros&quot; of the bible talking about continually grabbing a woman's breasts.<br />
<br />
Read on though, it gets worse...<br />
<br />
&quot;Now when evening came David arose from his bed and walked around on the roof of the king's house, and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful in appearance. So David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, 'Is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?' And David sent messengers and took her, and when she came to him, he lay with her; and when she had purified herself from her uncleanness, she returned to her house. And the woman conceived, and she sent and told David, and said, 'I am pregnant.'&quot; 2 Samuel 11:1-5<br />
This is a story any decent parent would find outrageous, telling, as it does, about nudity, covetousness, forced sex and illegitimate pregnancy. No one in their right mind would expose their children to decadence yet the Bible is rife with such de************************ions.<br />
<br />
Let's take a look at another example from the &quot;good book&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it came about after these events that his master's wife looked with desire at Joseph, and she said, 'Lie with me.' But he refused. And she caught him by his garment, saying, 'Lie with me!' And he left his garment in her hand and fled, and went outside. When she saw he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside, she called to the men of her household, and said to them, 'See, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to make sport of us; he came in to me to lie with me, and I screamed, And it came about when he heard that I raised my voice and screamed, that he left his garment beside me and fled, and went outside.'&quot; Genesis 39:7-15<br />
Not being **************************** with asking for extra-marital sex, this married woman accuses an innocent man of rape when he refuses. What a disgusting example. <br />
But not as disgusting as what happened to Lot...<br />
<br />
&quot;And Lot went up to Zoar, and stayed in the mountains, and his two daughters with him. Then the firstborn said to the younger, 'Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of the earth. Come, let us make our father drink wine, and let us lie with him, that we may preserve our family through our father.' <br />
So they made their father drink wine that night, and the first-born went in and lay with her father; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose. And it came about on the morrow, that the first-born said to the younger, 'Behold, I lay last night with my father; let us make him drink wine tonight also; then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve our family through our father.'<br />
<br />
So they made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger arose and lay with him; and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose. Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father.&quot; Genesis 19:30-36<br />
<br />
Is such incestuous debauchery nice material for a bedtime story? They get their father drunk and have sex with him, both getting pregnant in the process. Perhaps they were still angry at him. After all, their own father was quite happy to offer them up for a gang-rape...<br />
<br />
&quot;Before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter; and they called to Lot and said to him, 'Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may know them.' But Lot went out to them at the doorway, and shut the door behind him, and said, 'Please, my brothers, do not act wickedly. Now behold, I have two daughters who have not had relations with a man; please let me bring them out to you, and do to them whatever you like...'&quot; Genesis 19:4-8<br />
<br />
Do we really want our young to sully their minds on such a story: the host of the two visitors offering his virgin daughters to be raped and abused by these men?<br />
<br />
Could biblical examples such as these be the reason for so much sexual abuse within families? Why let our children be exposed to something as despicable as that in the first place?<br />
<br />
Would you want your unsuspecting child to accidentally stumble across across the bible and read this?<br />
<br />
Judges 19:22<br />
<br />
Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him.<br />
<br />
19:23<br />
<br />
And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.<br />
<br />
19:24<br />
<br />
Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.<br />
<br />
19:25<br />
<br />
But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.<br />
<br />
19:26<br />
<br />
Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.<br />
<br />
19:27<br />
<br />
And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold.<br />
<br />
19:28<br />
<br />
And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place.<br />
<br />
19:29<br />
<br />
And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.<br />
<br />
What kind of morality is being taught here? What can we infer from such filth? Maybe to take as a role model a man who is too cowardly to stand up for himself but who considers it's ok to offer a female servant to a gang of rapists, let them abuse her all night, then, in the morning, cut her into pieces with a knife and send the pieces to different parts of the country?<br />
<br />
The Bible Encourages Violence And Glorifies Killing<br />
&quot;Thus David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and he struck the Philistine and killed him; but there was no sword in David's hand. Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it.&quot; 1 Samuel 17:50-51 <br />
&quot;Is this not David, of whom they sing in the dances saying, 'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?&quot; 1 Samuel 29:5<br />
<br />
Is this the reason the people wanted David, rather than Saul, to be their king, because he was better at killing?<br />
<br />
What a nice message Christians would have us send to our kids: glorify killing and give the person responsible for the most violence even more power.<br />
<br />
Remember, David had raped another man's wife resulting in her getting pregnant. This Christian role model then proceeds to deliberately plot her husbands' death to further<br />
<br />
his schemes:<br />
<br />
&quot;Now it came about in the morning that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah. And he had written in the letter, saying 'Place Uriah at the front line of the fiercest battle and withdraw from him, so that he may be struck down and die.' So it was as Joab kept watch on the city, that he put Uriah at the place where he knew there were valiant men. And the men of the city went out and fought against Joab and some of the people among David's servants fell; and Uriah the Hittite also died.&quot; 2 Samuel 11:14-17<br />
Why are Christians so determined to display murder and dismemberment, in obscene and gory detail before our children's eyes?<br />
<br />
&quot;And I will set My jealousy against you, that they may deal with you in wrath. They will remove your nose and your ears; and your survivors will fall by the sword. They will take your sons and your daughters; and your survivors will be consumed by the fire.&quot; Ezekiel 23:25 <br />
&quot;And behold, one of those where were with Jesus reached and drew out his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear.&quot; Matthew 26:51<br />
<br />
Why should we be willing to stand idly by and allow our little ones to be exposed to this violence? Can you imagine the horrendous nightmares caused by this sort of repulsive material:slaying and beheading, ears and noses being violently being cut off?<br />
<br />
How about considering the deep-seated mental problems that may be caused by the following verses? Christians seem to consider it beneficial for the very young to read about boys being systematically murdered. Instead of being banned outright, or at least kept far away from the curious eyes of innocent children, lest they become desensitized to violence and it's inherent dangers, the bible is freely available. What possible good could come from exposing our kids to violence such as this?<br />
<br />
&quot;And when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the magi, he became very enraged, and sent and slew all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its environs, from two years old and under.&quot; Matthew 2:16 <br />
&quot;And when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests; and the king said to the girl, 'Ask me for whatever you want and I will give it to you...' And she came in haste before the king and asked, saying, 'I want you to give me right away the head of John the Baptist on a platter....' And immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded him to bring back his head. And he went and beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.&quot; Mark 6:22-29<br />
<br />
&quot;And when they had driven him out of the city, they began stoning him, and the witnesses laid aside their robes at the feet of a young man named Saul. And they went on stoning Stephen as he called up the Lord and said, 'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!'&quot; Acts 7:58-59<br />
<br />
&quot;And they dressed Him up in purple and after weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on Him....And they kept beating His head with a reed, and spitting at Him.... And they led Him out to crucify Him.&quot; Mark 15:16-17<br />
<br />
Such casual violence, such graphic detail. Images of our fellow humans being beaten, spit on, mocked, and killed. A young woman asking for and receiving a man's severed head on a plate so she can give it as a present to her mother.<br />
<br />
Such brutality, where an innocent man is violently killed as others casually watch, is damaging the moral fabric of many nations. The Christian bible is a major factor in tearing apart our families and our communities. Everything possible must be done to remove this offensive writing from our children's eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;And all flesh that moved on the earth perished, birds and cattle and beasts and every swarming thing that swarmed upon the earth, and all mankind; of all that was on the dry land, all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died. Thus He blotted out every living thing that was upon the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky, and they were blotted out from the earth.&quot; Genesis 7:21-23<br />
<br />
Why Does The Bible Want Wives To Be Submissive?<br />
<br />
Many Christian men have a problem in dealing with women on equal terms and verses like this, when taught to our children serve to reinforce the irrational prejudices held by many.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything.&quot; Ephesians 5:22-24<br />
p&gt; Note that the all inclusive &quot;everything&quot; could allow husbands to submit their wives to anything, including rape, beatings, slavery, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
More Sex, Obscenities, Filth, Eating Dung And Drinking Piss<br />
Why don't todays Christians insist on the recommened bible punishment for adultery? Is it because so many Christians are unable to be faithful themselves and are more than willing to have sexual liaisons with other people's spouses?<br />
<br />
&quot;And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.&quot; (Leviticus 20:10-11)<br />

<br />
Eat Human Feces!<br />
<br />
How many good Christians today realize that their God has coprophilic tendencies?<br />
<br />
&quot;And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight. And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.&quot; (Ezekiel 4:12-13)<br />
One wonders what value, nutritional or moral, it would serve the people to eat human feces with their bread, as God ordered. Note, God here has also ordered, the voyeuristic-like observation of the feces coming out man. How many Christians realize that they worship a Scat God?<br />
<br />
Eating Dung And Drinking Piss<br />
<br />
&quot;But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?&quot; (II Kings 18:27)<br />
<br />
Whatever moral lesson an adult might gain from such questionable verses, one can only wonder. How many parents realize that their children, who might come across such filthy passages, could get the wrong message?<br />
<br />
Any mention of drinking of feces and urine in any secular writing would get considered obscene and sick by any righteous minded Christian. Then why should it not receive the same consideration if found in a bible? Might we ask what artistic or social value this verse presents?<br />
<br />
&quot;I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces.&quot;<br />
<br />
Note the word &quot;piss&quot; stands as one of the censored vulgar words of the public television industry. If Christians wish to censor such language from secular sources, then it behooves them to give themselves as an example and thus censor the obscene verses from their own Bible.<br />
<br />
Boil and Eat Your Son<br />
<br />
&quot;And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow. So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son....&quot; (II Kings 6:28-29)<br />
According to the Bible, a horrible famine took place in Samaria where in desperation, the people ate whatever they could. The cannibalistic eating of a son may provide sufficient nutrition for a mother but disregards the puissant nature of humans to protect their young. Although the Bible does not explain if the son had already died or if the parent deliberately killed him for food, this dreadful example goes against human nature. <br />
Long before bibles or written language, humans evolved as social animals that required the protection of their offspring. Only the dogmatic insistence of a belief-system could supersede the natural instincts of humans. Hopefully readers of the Bible who might one day experience a famine will not subvert their natural instinct for this kind of horrific example in ************************ure.<br />
<br />
If you cannot control your belief and wish to to eat your children, why not sacrifice your priest and eat him instead; that way you gain far more protein for you and your children, and when you say grace, you'll have someone to really thank for your food.<br />
<br />
Fatal Orgasm<br />
<br />
&quot;And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him. And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother. And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother. And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.&quot; (Genesis 38:7-10)<br />
These verses are beloved and misinterpreted by many Christians, who then insist in foisting their misrepresentation on impressionable children. <br />
The term &quot;onanism,&quot; from the name Onan, has come to stand for masturbation which has suffered a fate similar to sodomy in the sense that it has evolved to have a meaning far different from its original usage.<br />
<br />
Some time during the centuries, the character of the sinful act was changed. Instead of being recognized as a seldom performed interrupting of coitus, it became accepted as any form of self-stimulation that resulted in orgasm, and the entire character of the deed became altered. Onanism came to mean a sinful act of masturbation!<br />
<br />
This has resulted in a general bad impression of masturbation even in secular beliefs. For example many a parent has told his son not to masturbate for fear of going blind.<br />
<br />
Fecal disposal<br />
<br />
&quot;And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee: For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall they camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee.&quot; Deuteronomy 23:13-14<br />
<br />
These verses ask us to believe that God has concern for fecal waste disposal outside a military camp because God personally wishes to walk within the camp. Now really!<br />
<br />
God's Golden Hemorrhoids<br />
<br />
&quot;The LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed.&quot; Deuteronomy 28:27<br />
<br />
&quot;But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, [even] Ashdod and the coasts thereof&quot; I Samuel 5:6<br />
<br />
&quot;And it was [so], that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.&quot; (I Samuel 5:9)<br />
<br />
When Israel felt rebellious against God's plan, He threatened them with type of plague: &quot;emerods&quot; or by today's terminology, &quot;hemorrhoids.&quot; For some odd reason God first killed the men of Ashdod before He inflicted them with hemorrhoids.<br />
<br />
No wonder why so many atheists consider God a pain in the ass. But then again, Christians develop hemorrhoids too. If you or your children develop hemorrhoids, then you can tell them that God considers you an enemy. That should help them to sleep soundly...<br />
<br />
God Likes To Inflict Bowel Diseases<br />
<br />
&quot;Behold with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods: And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.&quot; II Chronicles 21:14-15<br />
<br />
&quot;And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease. And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.&quot; II Chronicles 12:18-19<br />
<br />
How are suppossed to instill a sense of justice and fairness into our children when there are many instances in the Bible where the Lord smites, not only men, but all the people including women and children. <br />
Why God would concern himself with giving an incurable cruel bowel disease where the person's guts spill out of the abdomen, goes beyond human decency and comprehension.<br />
<br />
God's Fecal Fetish<br />
<br />
&quot;If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart. Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with it.&quot; Malachi 2:2-3<br />
<br />
Amazingly God appears to have a fecal fetish.What should one think of a God that would smear feces upon the faces of his creations? Such vulgarity can hardly give good example to high morality.<br />
<br />
Kids, It's Time To Howl And Strip Naked!<br />
&quot;Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.&quot; Micah 1:8<br />
<br />
Picture in your mind a religious man of today stripping and running around totally nude and prophesying in public, wailing and hooting at the top of his lungs. No doubt the police would snatch him up in a second while citizens stare in embarrassment.<br />
<br />
Biblical Social Graces?<br />
Passing Wind<br />
<br />
Wherefore my bowels shall sound like a harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kirharesh. Isaiah 16:11<br />
<br />
Piss Crimes<br />
<br />
&quot;therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jerobo'am, and will cut off from Jerobo'am him that pisseth against the wall...&quot; I Kings 14:10<br />
<br />
If God brings evil, then what makes Him different from Satan? Although the unsanitary practice of urinating on walls might have caused serious erosion of the mud walls, bringing evil appears excessive punishment for such a minor offense.<br />
<br />
Pissing Against Walls<br />
<br />
&quot;And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.&quot; I Kings 16:11<br />
<br />
Consider that many Christians tell us to believe all of the Bible, must we also include this vulgar language as the inspiration of God? If it's inspired by God should we encourage our children to use vulgar language?(See also I Kings 14:10, 21:21; II Kings 9:8.)<br />
<br />
Prophesy in the nude<br />
<br />
&quot;At the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy lions, and put off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot. And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia; So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.&quot; Isaiah 20:2-4<br />
<br />
God seems not the least offended by nudity when it comes to prophesying, yet he imbues his followers with shame over their bodies and the nudity associated with sex, especially when it involves pagan sex worship.<br />
<br />
Our children are suffering because of this dreadful book and are crying out for our help. If we are to save them from this danger and rescue them from this moral turpitude, there is only one thing we can do: ban this book; ban the Bible. Don't you care enough about the children to do that?<br />

don't you think that they have a point on banning the distorted Bible?<br />
<br />
because see, if they ban it that means that there is no christianity, and therefore atheism will grow although most christians believe as we do that atheists are deranged and have no brain. and sorry atheists, the muslims have preceded you long ago on answering the christians.<br />

<br />
Although much of what has been written is true and we agree with, yet the way it was presented in and the conclusion derived thereafter we must differ and disagree with. x<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that the &quot;Bible&quot; has been distorted, yet we admit that it contains some &quot;Words of Allah&quot; therein and that there is &quot;some&quot; truth to it that led and continues to lead many to embrace Islam. Hence, banning the &quot;Bible&quot; altogether certainly serves the agenda of the athiests. What we should rather do, is to expose what is wrong as we see it, and offer the substitue from the Book of Allah, al-Qur'an, and the tradition of His Messenger Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam. x<br />
<br />
Yes, the article is presenting the athiests perspective and serving their agenda, and yes we should utilize what's in with what fits our interests, but at the same time we shouldn't simply copy &amp; paste w/o a commentary. x<br />
<br />
As such, I would beg the brother Husaina to share with us his thoughts on the issue for others to benefit from. x<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">«·ÕÃ«Ã</div><div class="date">23-12-07, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right akhi, however; the objection - if you will - was not over the premises, rather over the conclusion, that is to ban the bible altogether w/o offering the substitute, i.e., the Glorious Qur'an.x<br />
<br />
It would've been far more logical &amp; beneficial to draw a comparison between what the bible says vs what the Qur'an says in reference to the Prophets of Allah, as an example, and so on &amp; so forth point by point. x<br />
<br />
Posting the article &quot;as is&quot; will give the layman reader, especially a non-Muslim, the perception that we promote its conclusion, when actually it is not the case. What we need the Christians to do is rather to ponder over the prophecies appertaining to Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, the verses pointing to Tawhid, the verses negating the divinity of Jesus, peace be upon him, and so on &amp; so forth, because they do have an access to the Truth from their own book. As such, banning the Bible does not serve our purposes per say, rather it makes it difficult for &quot;some&quot; to be led to the Truth of al-Islam. x<br />
<br />
If you are capable of commenting on each point and illustrate the Islamic perspective, so be it (more power to you). If not, it is hoped that these responses serve the purpose. :) x<br />
