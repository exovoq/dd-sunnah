(Shia Objection)<br />
Hadrat Umar (radiallahu anhu) prevented Rasulullah (sallallahu<br />
alaihi wasallam) from writing out his last Testament in which he<br />
wanted to specify the Khilafat of Hadrat Ali (radiallahu anhu)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Among the fabrications and slander of the Shi'as against Hadrat Umar<br />
(radhiallahu anhu) is their claim that he (Hadrat Umar) had<br />
prevented Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) from writing a<br />
last Testament which he had desired to write during his last illness.<br />
<br />
During the last illness, on a Thursday, Rasulullah (sallallahu<br />
alaihi wasallam) asked the Sahaba who were present to bring pen and<br />
paper to enable him to write something which will save them from<br />
going astray. Hadrat Umar (radhiallahu anhu) said that Rasulullah<br />
(sallallahu alaihi wasallam) was in pain (it being his Maradhul<br />
Maut) and the Kitab of Allah was sufficient. Difference of opinion<br />
arose among the group present. When voices were raised, Rasulullah<br />
(sallallahu alaihi wasallam) ordered them all to leave.<br />
<br />
On the basis of this episode, the Shi'as charge Hadrat Umar<br />
(radhiallahu anhu) with the following crimes:<br />
<br />
(A) That he prevented Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) from<br />
writing out his last Testament in which he wanted to specify the<br />
Khilafat of Hadrat Ali (radhiallahu anhu).<br />
<br />
(B) In having prevented Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam),<br />
Hadrat Umar (according to the Shi'as) is guilty of preventing the<br />
delivery of Wahi which Nabi (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) wanted to<br />
have written.<br />
<br />
If the Ahadith relevant to this episode are examined with a clear<br />
and unbiased mind, the falsity of the Shi'a charges will be manifest.<br />
<br />
(1) The request or order for pen and paper made by Rasulullah<br />
(sallallahu alaihi wasallam) was not made directly and exclusively<br />
to Hadrat Umar ( radhiallahu anhu). A group of Sahaba was present.<br />
In some narrations, the term (bring for me) is used by Rasulullah<br />
(sallallahu alaihi wasallam). This is a plural verb directed to the<br />
group. In a narration in Musnad-e-Ahmad, Hadrat Ali (radhiallahu<br />
anhu) mentions that Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) had<br />
ordered him (i.e. Hadrat Ali) to bring the writing materials.<br />
<br />
Why should the charge of refusal to bring the writing materials now<br />
be leveled against Hadrat Umar (radhiallahu anhu) He was not<br />
specifically singled out for this task. In fact, if anyone was<br />
specifically deputed to bring the writing materials, it was a Hadrat<br />
Ali (radhiallahu anhu). Why then do the Shi'as refrain from<br />
criticizing Hadrat Ali (radhiallahu anhu) for having failed to<br />
comply with Rasulullah's (sallallahu alaihi wasallam)<br />
instruction?<br />
<br />
Hadrat Ali (radhiallahu anhu) on account of the severity of Nabi-e-<br />
Kareem's (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) illness, he did not comply.<br />
He did not want to leave the presence of Rasulullah (sallallahu<br />
alaihi wasallam) whose demise, according to Hadrat Ali (radhiallahu<br />
anhu) was imminent. So the Shi'a charge of disobeying Rasulullah<br />
(sallallahu alaihi wasallam) should be directed by them against<br />
Hadrat Ali (radhiallahu anhu), not against Hadrat Umar (radhiallahu<br />
anhu).<br />
<br />
(2) Secondly, Hadrat Umar (radhiallahu anhu) had merely presented<br />
his opinion on the matter. He felt that it was unjust and an<br />
imposition of a burden on Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) to<br />
have him dictate a testament in his state of extreme pain which he<br />
experienced during his last illness. When Hadrat Umar (radhiallahu<br />
anhu) presented his opinion, two groups formed. One group agreeing<br />
and the other dissenting. As a result of this difference, voices<br />
were raised, and Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) ordered<br />
them all out.<br />
<br />
(3) If Hadrat Umar (radhiallahu anhu) was guilty as the Shi'as<br />
allege, why did Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) order the<br />
whole group to leave? This group included Hadrat Ali and Hadrat Ibn<br />
Abbas (radhiallahu anhuma). It is quite obvious from the tenor of<br />
the Hadith that Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) asked them<br />
to leave because of their mutual argument, not because Hadrat Umar<br />
(radhiallahu anhu) or anyone else had prevented him from writing or<br />
having the testament written.<br />
<br />
(4) If whatever Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) wanted to<br />
write was Wahi (Divine Revelation), then it is inconceivable that<br />
anyone or anything could have prevented him from proclaiming the<br />
Wahi which is obviously part of the Qur`an. How is it possible for<br />
Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) to have concealed<br />
(Nauthubillah!) the Wahi of Allah Ta`ala when throughout his life he<br />
propagated the Truth and the Qur`an in the face of the greatest<br />
dangers, persecution, tortures and hardships? Even in the initial<br />
stages of his mission when he was all alone and weak, he never<br />
desisted from proclaiming the Wahi of Allah Ta`ala, when he and the<br />
Sahaba were suffering brutal tortures and hardships under the Kuffar<br />
of Makkah.<br />
<br />
How can people of Iman ever accept that Rasulullah (sallallahu<br />
alaihi wasallam) had withheld revelation or vital information of the<br />
Deen merely because of an argument between the two groups of Sahaba?<br />
How can this be imagined when the Qur`an says:<br />
<br />
&quot;O Rasool! Deliver what has been revealed to you from your Rabb.<br />
If you do not, then you have not delivered (fulfilled) your<br />
mission.&quot;<br />
<br />
Several months prior to Rasulullah's demise the following ayat<br />
was revealed:<br />
<br />
&quot;This day have I perfected for you your Deen and I have completed<br />
for you My favour and have chosen for you Islam as (your) Deen.&quot;<br />
<br />
When the Deen was already perfected, it is inconceivable that<br />
Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) desired to write something<br />
in addition to the perfected Message of Allah Ta`ala. If Rasulullah<br />
(sallallahu alaihi wasallam) had withheld vital information of the<br />
Deen, he would come within the purview of the aforementioned verse<br />
in which it is said that `then you would not have delivered your<br />
Mission.' But, it is unanimous in the Ummah and crystal clear<br />
that Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) had delivered every<br />
aspect of the Deen. Not an iota of Allah's Wahi was concealed as the<br />
Shi'a ****************************ion implies.<br />
<br />
Which Mu`min is prepared to believe that Rasulullah (sallallahu<br />
alaihi wasallam) had concealed any part of the Deen simply because<br />
Hadrat Umar (radhiallahu anhu) had opined that there was no need for<br />
writing anything during this state of illness of Nabi-e-Kareem<br />
(sallallahu alaihi wasallam) When Hadrat Umar (radhiallahu anhu)<br />
with all his hatred for Islam during his pre-Islam days, together<br />
with the might and venom of the entire Quraish were unable to deter<br />
Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) from proclaiming the Deen,<br />
how can it be intelligently accepted that Rasulullah (sallallahu<br />
alaihi wasallam) withheld and concealed the Truth and the Deen when<br />
there was absolutely no threat from any quarter confronting him?<br />
<br />
(5) This episode transpired on Thursday. Rasulullah (sallallahu<br />
alaihi wasallam) lived another four days after this incident. If he<br />
had vital Deeni information or Wahi to deliver, why did he not<br />
execute this task during the four days succeeding this episode? What<br />
was there to prevent him? And, if there was anything to prevent him<br />
and he succumbed to the pressure, it will lead to the kufr<br />
conclusion that Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) was guilty<br />
of Kitmanul Haqq - Kitman-e-Deen (Taqiyyah - concealing the Truth<br />
and concealing the Deen) - Nauthubillah! Only Shi'as possess the<br />
capacity for entertaining such kufr and formulating such slander<br />
which blemish the concept of Divine Nubuwwah.<br />
<br />
During the four days after this episode, Hadrat Umar (radhiallahu<br />
anhu) was not in the constant company of Rasulullah (sallallahu<br />
alaihi wasallam) nor was there any impediment to prevent him from<br />
writing or proclaiming verbally what he had wished to have written<br />
on that particular day (Thursday). Then what precluded him from<br />
revealing to Hadrat Ali (radhiallahu anhu) or Hadrat Ibn Abbas<br />
(radhiallahu anhu) or to any other Sahabi in the group which was in<br />
favour of the testament whatever he wanted to have written. There<br />
was sufficient time and opportunity in the four days prior to his<br />
demise for recording whatever he wanted to say. But, on the<br />
contrary, he simply left the subject. This indicates that whatever<br />
he had wanted to have written was advice in general-such naseehat<br />
which existed in the Qur`an and Sunnah. It is precisely for this<br />
reason that Hadrat Umar (radhiallahu anhu) initially said &quot;The<br />
Kitaab of Allah is by us.&quot;<br />
<br />
(6) If Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) was constrained to<br />
abstain from having his Message recorded, he could have proclaimed<br />
the Message verbally at any other time subsequent to this incident<br />
when Hadrat Umar (radhiallahu anhu) was not around. But, it is kufr,<br />
clear and conspicuous, to even imagine that Hadrat Umar's<br />
presence or anyone else's presence could deter Rasulullah (sallallahu<br />
alaihi wasallam) from proclaiming Wahi of Allah Ta`ala.<br />
<br />
(7) On the occasion of the Treaty of Hudaibiyyah, Nabi (sallallahu<br />
alaihi wasallam) instructed Hadrat Ali (radhiallahu anhu), on the<br />
insistence of the Kuffar, to erase the word, &quot;Rasulullah&quot;,<br />
from the treaty document. However, Hadrat Ali (radhiallahu anhu)<br />
emphatically refused and Nabi (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) then<br />
erased the word with his own hands. But no Shi'a criticizes Hadrat<br />
Ali (radhiallahu anhu) for an act which superficially appears to be<br />
disobedience.<br />
<br />
(Note: It is not our claim that Hadrat Ali's refusal was<br />
disobedience nor did Rasulullah -sallallahu alaihi wasallam-construe<br />
his refusal as disobedience). The point in mentioning this incident<br />
is simply to present an analogy. If the Shi'as assert, as they do,<br />
that Hadrat Umar (radhiallahu anhu) had opposed the wishes of<br />
Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) , then to a greater degree<br />
should they charge Hadrat Ali (radhiallahu anhu) with disobedience<br />
because he had not only ignored a wish of Rasulullah (sallallahu<br />
alaihi wasallam), but refused a command.<br />
<br />
(8) In the unanimous view of all the authorities of the Shariah,<br />
Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) is Ma`soom, i.e. he is<br />
Divinely guarded against all sin and disobedience. It is<br />
inconceivable that the soul chosen by Allah Ta`ala to deliver the<br />
Qur`an had concealed or withheld any part of the Deen. As far as the<br />
Shariah is concerned, Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) had<br />
delivered it in entirety and perfection.<br />
<br />
(9) It is quite obvious that whatever Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi<br />
wasallam) wanted to have recorded pertained to general advice, hence<br />
later on he did not even deem it necessary to pursue the matter.<br />
<br />
(10) Even after having cancelled his initial proposal of having the<br />
advice recorded, he instructed the Sahaba during the very same<br />
episode to:<br />
<br />
1) Expel the Mushrikeen from the Arabian peninsula.<br />
<br />
2) To be hospitable to foreign delegations as was his practice.<br />
<br />
3) Despatch the army of Usamah.<br />
<br />
Although he ordered the Sahaba to leave, he nevertheless, issued<br />
these last very important instructions. It is quite probable that<br />
these were the very things he wanted to have written down. He<br />
regarded these acts as vital, hence he made this order during his<br />
last illness immediately after the episode out of which the Shi'as<br />
endeavour to eke substantiation for their fabricated slanders and<br />
charges against Hadrat Umar (radhiallahu anhu).<br />
<br />
(11) When Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) asked them to<br />
leave, he said :<br />
<br />
&quot; It is not appropriate for you to argue in my presence.&quot;<br />
<br />
It is abundantly clear that he asked them to leave because of their<br />
mutual argument. He did not make any reference to the issue of the<br />
dispute between the two groups. When the Sahaba sought further<br />
clarification from Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam), he<br />
commented:<br />
<br />
&quot; The state in which I am (presently) is better than what you are<br />
inviting me to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Immediately after this comment, he commanded the expulsion of the<br />
Mushrikeen from Arabia. All this indicates that he did not attach<br />
importance to whatever he had initially wanted to have written or<br />
that he had changed his mind.<br />
<br />
(12) The logical conclusion of the Shi'a accusation is that<br />
Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) had either withheld or<br />
concealed information pertaining to the Deen as a result of an<br />
argument among the Sahaba. In a Hadith in Bukhari Shareef, Hadrat<br />
Aisha (radhiallahu anha) said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoever says that Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) had<br />
concealed anything from what has been revealed to him, has most<br />
certainly spoken a lie. Allah Ta`ala says (in the Qur`an): `O<br />
Rasool ! Deliver what has been revealed to you from your<br />
Rabb...'&quot;<br />
<br />
It should now be clear that the charges of the Shi'as against Hadrat<br />
Umar (radhiallahu anhu) are baseless and pure slander. By<br />
implication they are also accusing Rasulullah (sallallahu alaihi<br />
wasallam) of having concealed the Haqq on account of fear for Hadrat<br />
Umar (radhiallahu anhu) But the absurdity of this implication is<br />
manifest. Furthermore, whatever charge they have leveled against<br />
Hadrat Umar (radiallahu anhu) in this issue rebounds on their<br />
greatest Imam, Hadrat Ali (radhiallahu anhu) as well, because the<br />
instruction to bring the writing material was initially issued to<br />
him. May Allah Ta`ala save us from the vile slander and kufr of the<br />
Shi'as.<br />
<br />
