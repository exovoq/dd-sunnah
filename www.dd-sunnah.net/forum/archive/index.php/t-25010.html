<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">«·√⁄‘Ï</div><div class="date">29-12-03, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for their statement that he beat with the staff, I have not heard it from anyone -neither rebel nor obedient. It is a falsehood which is related and a lie that is told. (1) By Allah, it is prohibited. <br />
<br />
As for his going above the step of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, I did not hear it from any of those who have taqwa. It is an objectionable rumour that is related and mentioned. The heart of the one who changes is changed. Our `ulama' said, &quot;If it is sound, this does not contain anything that makes his blood allowable.&quot; It is not impossible that that is true, but if that is the case then the Companions  did not object to him doing it so they must have thought that it was permissible in the first place, or there must have been a reason which called for it. If that was not the case then there is no discussion. (2)<br />
<br />
As for his being routed on the day of Hunayn, his flight of  the Day of Uhud, his absence from Badr and the pledge of Ridwan, `Abdullah b. `Umar clarified the principle of the judgment about the pledge, Badr and Uhud. As for the Day of Hunayn, there was only a handful who stayed by the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, there is no explanation in the `Sahih' of the matter regarding those who stayed. There are various statements. One of them is that the only ones who remained with him were al-`Abbas and his sons, `Abdullah and Quthum. This disagreement is all you need to know. The Companions shared in this event. Allah and His Messenger forgave him. It is not lawful to mention what Allah and His Messenger and the believers have dropped. Al Bukhari related, (3) &quot;A man came to Ibn `Umar and asked him about `Uthman. He mentioned the good things he had done. He said, &quot;Perhaps that vexes you?' He said, `Yes.' He said, `May Allah abase you.' Then he asked him about `Ali and he mentioned the good things which he had done. He said, `That is his house in the middle of the houses of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' He said, `Perhaps that vexes you?' He said, `Certainly.' He said, `May Allah abase you.' He left.&quot; Ali had exerted all his effort. It was already stated in the hadith, &quot;Islam is built on five.&quot; There is more in it by al-Bukhari on `Ali and `Uthman. (4)<br />
<br />
Al-Bukhari also related, (5) from the hadith of `Uthman b. `Abdullah b. Mawhad who said &quot;A man came from the people of Egypt intending to go on the Hajj to the House. He saw some people sitting and he said, `Who is the shaykh among them?' They said, &quot;Abdullah b. `Umar.' He said, `Ibn `Umar, I will ask you something. Relate it to me! Do you know that `Uthman fled on  the Day of Uhud?' He said, `Yes.' He said, `Do you know that he was absent from Badr?' He said, `Yes.' He said, `Do you know that he was absent  from the pledge of Hudaybiyya and did not attend it?' He said, `Yes.' He said, `Allah is greater.' Ibn `Umar said, `Come and I will make it clear to you. As for his flight on the day of Uhud, I testify that Allah has forgiven him and pardoned him. As for his absence from Badr, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,  was his wife and she was ill. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peae, told him, `You will have the  reward and share of a man of those who are present at Badr.&quot;' (6)<br />
<br />
As for his absence from the pledge of Ridwan, if anyone had been more respected in Makka than `Uthman, he would have sent him in his place. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent `Uthman (7)  and the pledge of Ridwan occurred after `Uthman had gone to Makka. (8)<br />
 <br />
The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, held out his right hand, saying, &quot;This is the hand of `Uthman.&quot; Then Ibn `Umar said to him, `Take this with you now.&quot;' (9) <br />
<br />
As for his preventing `Ubaydullah b. `Umar b. al-Khattab from being killed for al-Hurmuzan, that is false. (10)   If he did not do it, there were many companions (of his Khalifate). This business also occurred at the beginning. (11)  It was said, &quot;Al-Hurmuzan worked to provoke the murder of `Umar. He carried the dagger and it was seen under his garment.(12)    `Ubaydullah killed him when `Uthman was  not the ruler. Perhaps `Uthman did not think that `Ubaydullah deserved punishemnt since the state of al-Hurmuzan and what he did was not proven. (13)  If none understood to demand it, how could it be sound to  look into an unproven business when all these possibilites existed?<br />
<br />
As for their statement that a letter was found with the rider or with his slave (and none at all says that it was his slave) (14)  addressed to `Abdullah b. Sa`d b. Abi Sarh, telling him to kill its bearers. (15)  `Uthman said to them, &quot;Bring two witnesses to that. If not, I swear that I never wrote it nor did I command that.&quot; (16)<br />
<br />
It might have been written in `Uthman's words, done in his handwriting and sealed with his seal. (17) They said, &quot;Then surrender Marwan to us.&quot; He said, &quot;I will not do it.&quot; If he had surrendered him, that would have been unjust. (18) <br />
<br />
The most likely of what is related in his story is that because of the previous decision, certain people conspired against him with malice which was believed by those who wanted something and did not get it and who harboured a great envy whose sickness showed. A person is moved to that by lack of the deen, lack of certainty, and preference for this world before the next world. (19)   When you look at this, you will clearly see the baseness of their hearts and the falseness of their business. (20)  Al-Ghafiqi al-Misri was the Amir of the people. (21) Kinan b. Bishr at-Tujibi, (22)  Sawdan b. Hamran, (23) `Abdullah b. Budayl b. Warqa' al-Khuza'i, (24)  Hukaym b. Jabala from the  people of Basra (25)  and Malik b. al-Harith al-Ashtar (26)  were in the group of those leaders of theirs, as well as others. They stirred up the sedition, so `Uthman expelled them by his ijtihad. They went in a group to Mu`awiya.(27)  He reminded them by Allah and by taqwa against  perverting the situation and breaking up the wholeness of the community (28)  until Zayd b. Sawhan said to him (according to what is related.),(29)  &quot;How much you go on at us about authority and the Quraysh! The Arabs still eat from the hilts of their swords while the Quraysh  are merchants.&quot; (30)<br />
<br />
Mu`awiya said to him, &quot;You have no mother! I remind you by Islam and you mention the jahiliyya to me! May Allah make unacceptable those who came frequently to the Amir al-Mu'minin because of you!  You are not among those who are helped or harmed. Leave me!&quot; (31)<br />
<br />
Ibn al-Kiwa' informed him about the people of sedition (32)  in every land and their conspiracies. (33)  He wrote to `Uthman to inform him about that. He sent their individuals to them. Mu'awiya expelled them, (34)  and then they went to `Abdu'r-Rahman b. Khalid b. al-Walid (35)  and he imprisoned them and rebuked them. He told them, &quot;Remember what you mentioned to Mu'awiya.&quot; (36)  He held them and kept them abased until they repented after a year had passed. (37) He wrote about them to `Uthman and Uthman told him to send them to him. When they stood in front of him, they reiterated their repentance and they took an oath that they were telling the truth  and said that they were innocent of what they were accused of. (38) He let them choose about where they wanted to go. Each of them chose a city: Kufa, Basra or Egypt. He sent them out and wherever they went, they rebelled and agitated until other groups joined them. (39) <br />
<br />
Those who went to `Uthman (40)  were: Abdu'r-Rahman b. `Udays al-Balawi, in charge of the people of Egypt,(41)  Hukaym b.Jabala, in charge of the people of Basra, (42)  and al-Ashtar Malik b. al-Harith an-Nakh`i, in charge of the people of Kufa. (43)  They came to Medina at the beginning of Dhu'l-Qa'da, 35 A.H. (44) `Uthman received them. They said, &quot;Call for a copy of the Qur'an.&quot; He called for it. They said, &quot;Open to the ninth,&quot; (45)  meaning Sura Yunus. They said, &quot;Read.&quot; He read until he reached Allah's words, &quot;Has Allah given  permission, or do you forge lies against Allah?&quot; They told him, &quot;Stop.&quot; They said to him, &quot;Do you think that Allah has given you permission for the hima which you have made  or have you forged lies on Allah?&quot; He said, &quot;Finish the ayat. It was revealed about such-and-such. `Umar made the hima and when there were camels, he enlarged the hima.&quot; (46)<br />
<br />
They began to interrogate him in that way but he defeated them. Finally he said to them, &quot;What do you want?&quot;<br />
They made an agreement with him and wrote  down five or six stipulations on it: (47) That the exile be returned, that the Amir give to the one who was deprived, that the booty be given  in full, that he be just in the division and that he appoint those who had trust and strength. They wrote all of that in a document. He enjoined  them not to break from the community nor leave the community. Then they went back well ****************************ed. (48) <br />
<br />
It was said that he sent `Ali to them and they agreed on the above-mentioned five stipulations and went back well ****************************ed. While they were on their way, (49) a rider stopped before them. (50) Therefore they examined the letter. They found a letter which was ascribed to `Uthman, and bore his seal, addressed to the governor of Egypt. It ordered him to crucify them and cut off their hands and feet. (51) They advanced on Madina.(52)  They went to `Ali and said to him, &quot;Don't you see that the  enemy of Allah has written such-and-such about us? Allah had made his blood lawful&quot; They said to him, &quot;Join us.&quot; He said, &quot;By Allah, I will not join you.&quot; They said, &quot;Then why  did you write  to us?&quot; He said, &quot;By Allah, I did not write  to you.&quot; They looked at each other.(53)  Then `Ali left Madina.<br />
<br />
They went to `Uthman and said to him, &quot;You wrote such-and-such about us.&quot; He told them to bring two of the muslims as witnesses or he would take an oath as we already mentioned. They did not accept this. (54)  They broke the treaty and laid siege to him. (55) <br />

================================================== =======<br />
<br />
  1. The report and hadith are divulged: made public and evident. &quot;Natha&quot; is like praise, but it is in both good and evil. Praise is only for good.<br />
.<br />
<br />
  2. The mosque of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant  him peace, had a narrow courtyard in the time of the Prophet and the Khalifate of Abu Bakr. One of the virtues of `Uthman in the time of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was that when the number of Companions increased, he purchased some land for a courtyard with his money by which the mosque of the Prophet was enlarged. Then the `Amir al-Mu`minin `Umar widened it and include the house of al-`Abbas b. `Abdu'l-Muttalib in it. Then the number of those who prayed increased with the number of the inhabitants of Madina and those who came to visit. The Amir al- Mu`minin `Uthman widened it again and made its length one hundred and sixty cubits and its width one hundred and fifty cubits and renewed its foundations. The capacity of the mosque and the increase in the number of those who attended it and the distance some of them were from the mimbar in the khutba could be the reason for making it necessary to raise the speaker so that he could see them and they could see him and listen to him.<br />
<br />
  3. In `The Book of the Virtues of the Companions' (Book 62, chap. 9, pt. 4, p. 208) from the hadith of Sa`d b. `Ubayda.<br />
<br />
  4. Perhaps the author is indicating the hadith of Ibn `Umar in the book of the tafsir of the `Sahih' of al-Bukhrai (book 65, chap. 2, the `Tafsir' of al-Baqara, hadith 30, pt. 5, p.157). <br />
<br />
5. In `The Book of the Virtues of the Companions' (book 26, chap. 7, pt. 4, pp. 203-204). <br />
<br />
  6. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent the good news of the victory in Badr with Zayd b. Haritha to `Uthman in Madina. Usama b. Zayd said (in what at-Tabari [2:276] related), &quot;The news came to us while we were levelling the earth over Ruqayya, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who was married to `Uthman b. `Affan. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, left me in charge of her along with `Uthman b. `Affan. Then is Rabi' al-Awwal, the year following the Battle of Badr. `Uthman married Umm Kulthum, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah. She went to live with him in Jumada al-Akhira.<br />
<br />
  7. Before  he sent `Uthman, the Prophet wanted to send `Umar b. al-Khattab to Makka to convey what he brought to the nobles of Quraysh. `Umar said, &quot;Messenger of Allah, I fear for myself with the Quraysh. There are none of the Banu `Adi b. Ka`b in Makka to protect me. But I will show you a man who is more esteemed thanme there, `Uthman b. `Affan.&quot; The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,  summoned him and sent him to Abu Sufyan and the nobles of Quraysh.<br />
<br />
  8. Because when `Uthman conveyed his message in that journey, he was detained for some days and did not return to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, at the time he was meant to return. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, heard that his ambassador had been killed. Therefore the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,  summoned the Companions to the Pledge of Ridwan to help `Uthman. He intended to go with his Companions to Makka and deal with the idol worshippers because of the news of `Uthman's murder. The Pledge of Ridwan was one of the marks of honour accorded `Uthman. What honour is greater? The forces of Islam gathered under the leadership of their greatest Messenger to take revenge for this man who was beloved to the muslims and who had the high position with the first and the last. When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, later learned that `Uthman was alive at the moment in which the Companions had gathered to take the pledge, he proceeded to complete the pledge according to his Sunna, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. When he began a business, he completed it, even if the reason for it had gone. Then `Uthman had a doubled honour since the hand of the Messenger of Allah represented his hand in the contract of the pledge for him. So the pledge of Ridwan was to help `Uthman and all of the Companions took a contract with their own hands except for `Uthman, and the noblest hand in existence took his place and gave his pledge for him. If  `Uthman had no other honour in his life except this, it would have been enough.<br />
<br />
  9. It is extraordinary  to find a community where ignorant men censure `Uthman for being absent from the Pledge of Ridwan when they include men who were aware of his courage when people advanced to shed the blood of this merciful Khalif for various reasons - and this was one of them. Since a man who came to worship Allah in the Hajj has this sort of ignorance which he then openly stated to a group of the Companions of Quryash whose  leader was `Abdullah b. `Umar, it is not surprising that there still was a need to clarify the truth in the time of Qadi Abu Bakr ibn al-`Arabi. People like us in this time are aware that `Uthman is still in a position, with regard to part of his community, which demands justice, and he still needs to be defended from bad words. This is what leaves us in our current state among the nations and the state in which we will continue to sink. &quot;Allah does not change a people until they change what is in themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
  10. By the testimony of al-Qamadhban, the son of al-Hurmuzan, at-Tabari related (5:43-44, Egyptian edition) from Sayf b. `Umar with his isnad to Abu Mansur. He said, &quot;I heard al-Qamadhban speak about the killing of his father. He said, `When `Uthman was appointed, he called me and gave me power over him (i.e. `Ubaydullah b. `Umar b. al-Khattab). Then he said, &quot;This is the one who killed your father. You are more entitled to him than me, so go and kill him.&quot; I took him out and everyone in the land went with me. They were begging for him. I said to them, &quot;Can I kill him?&quot; they said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and they abused `Ubaydullah. I said, &quot;Do you have anything to prevent it?&quot; They said, &quot;No,&quot; and they abused him. So I left him to Allah and to them and they took me away. By Allah, I only reached the house at the head and shoulders of men.&quot;' These are the words of the son of al-Hurmuzan. Every just person believed (and perhaps the son of al-Hurmuzan also believed) that the blood of the Amir al-Mu`minin `Umar lay on the neck of al-Hurmuzan and that Abu Lu`lu'a was only an implement in the hand of this Persian.<br />
<br />
  11. `Uthman acted in this matter after he had consulted the Companions about it. At-Tabari said (5:41), `&quot;Uthman sat at the side of the mosque and called `Ubaydullah while he was sitting in the house of Sa`d b. Abi Waqqas. He is the one who took the sword from his hand. `Uthman said to a group of the Muhajirun and the Ansar. `Tell me what I must do in this matter which splits Islam?' `Ali said, `I think that you should kill him.' One of the Muhajirun said, &quot;Umar was killed yesterday and then his son is to be killed today!?' `Amr b. al-`As said, `Amir al-Mu'minin, Allah would have forgiven you if this had happened while you had power over the muslims. However, this took place before you had power.' `Uthman  said, `I am their guardian. I make it a blood-wit and I will pay it with my own money.&quot;'<br />
<br />
  12. In `The History' of at-Tabari (5:42), is the hadith of Sa`id b. al-Musayyib. He related that `Abdu'r-Rahman b. Abi Bakr as- Siddiq said on the morning when `Umar was attacked, &quot;Yesterday evening I passed by Abu Lu`lu`a, Jufayna (who was christian from the people of Hira and a tutor to Sa`d b. Abi Waqqas) and al- Hurmuzan were with him. They were speaking secretly. When I approached them, they jumped up and they dropped a dagger. It had two heads and the handle was in the middle. Look and see what dagger `Umar was killed with.&quot;  A man from the Banu Tamim went out to investigate. The Tamimi came back to them. He had pursued Abu Lu`lu`a when he left `Umar and caught him. He brought the dagger which `Abdu'r-Rahman b. Abi Bakr had described. `Ubaydullah b. `Umar heard that. He held back until `Umar died. Then he girded on his sword and went to al-Hurmuzan and killed him.<br />
<br />
  13. Similarly the sage of the community, `Abdullah b. `Abbas, held the opinion that it was permitted to kill the unbelieving Persians who were in Madina without exception. Ibn Taymiyya said in the Path of the Sunna (3:200), `&quot;Abdullah b. `Abbas spoke when `Umar was attacked and `Umar said to him, `You and your father used to want many infidels to come to Madina.' Ibn  `Abbas had more fiqh and more deen than `Ubaydullah b. `Umar and was much more excellent. He asked `Umar for a general permission to kill the infidel Persians who were in Madina when they were suspected of corruption. He believed that this sort of thing was permitted. If al-Hurmuzan was among those individuals who had assisted in `Umar's murder, he was one of those who corrupt the land. Therefore he should have been killed for that. If he had found that the slain man was someone whose  blood was protected, then it would have been forbidden to kill him. However, the killer thought and believed that it was lawful to kill him by this clear suspicion. That suspicion which he had, averts punishment from the killer (i.e. from `Ubaydullah b. `Umar). I said, `&quot;Uthman  believed this when he spared him the blood-wit and paid it fom his own propety.&quot; `Ubaydullah b. `Umar killed al-Hurmuzan. He also killed the daughter of Abu Lu`lu`a. He also killed Jufayna an-Nasrani because he was also suspected of that. The enemies of `Uthman, May Allah be pleased with him, said that he did not take any retaliation from `Ubaydullah for that. The answer is that the daughter of Abu Lu`lu`a was a magian and Jufayna was a christian. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said as has come in al-Bukhari, &quot;A muslim is not killed for a kafir.&quot; `Uthman defended their deen when he paid the blood-wit of al-Hurmuzan after al-Hurmuzan's son had forgiven `Ubaydullah as we saw elsewhere. If something like the murder of the Amir al-Mu`minin `Umar b. al-Khattab had occurred in any other land, no matter what the level of its civilization, they would not have done what the Companions did in their forbearance, which went to the very limit, even to the extent of  killing the son of the Amir al- Mu'minin who had been murdered by treachery, depravity and blameworthy attack. <br />
<br />
  14. They said that he was a slave in charge of the zakat, i.e. he was one of the herdsmen of the zakat camels. The camels of the zakat numbered many thousands and they  had hundreds of herdsmen. If it is said that he was one of the herdsmen of the zakat camels, even their leaders did not know their names because of their great number, let alone the Amir al-Muminin, his great agents and helpers, assuming that he actually was one of the herdsmen of the zakat camels. How easy it would be for those rebels to hire him for their purposes. It is proven that al-Ashtar and Hukaym b. Jabala remained behind in Madina when the rebels left it, after they were **************************** with the answers and proofs of `Uthman. While al-Ashtar and Hukaym b. Jabala remained, the plot involving the letter  and its carrier was completed as a means of renewing the sedition and to bring back the rebels. None except al-Ashtar and his companions had any profit in renewing the sedition. How many tricks they used which  were more tortuous than simply hiring a herdsman who tended the zakat camels! They have mentioned that Muhammad b. Abi Hudhayfa, the fosterling of `Uthman al-Abiq by his favour, was at that very moment in Egypt provoking people against the Amir al-Mu`minin and forging false letters ascribed to the wives of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. He took camels and emaciated them, and put men outside the houses in fustat with their faces towards the sun so that their faces would look like those of travellers. Then he commanded them to go out to the Hijazi road in Egypt and send a messenger to tell people that  they were coming. When they met them, they said that they were bringing letters from the wives of the Prophet, may Allah bless  him and grant  him peace, complaining about the rule of `Uthman. These letters were read out in the mosque of `Amr in Fustat to the assembly of the people although they were forged and false. Those who carried them had been in Egypt the entire time and they had not gone to the Hijaz at all. (Look at `The Book' by Sadiq `Urjun about `Uthman b. `Affan, pp.132-133). Forging letters in the tragedy of the attack on the Amir al- Mu`minin `Uthman was one of the weapons that the attackers used on every side and in all cases. We have had one example of that, and more will come later. <br />
<br />
  15. How can he have written to `Abdullah b. Sa`d b. Abi Sarh when he had given `Abdullah permission to come to Madina and knew that he had left Egypt (at-Tabari, 5:122) and he knew that the one with power in Fustat was  Muhammad b. Abi Hudhayfa, the head of the rebels and their chief in the region? The transmitters of the reports are also confused about the ****************************s of the forged letter when they try to specify its ****************************s. That will all be discussed later. <br />
<br />
  16. Ibn Taymiyya said in `The Path of the Sunna' (3:18), &quot;Everyone who knows anything about the state of `Uthman knowns that he was not one of those who would command the death of Muhammad b. Abi Bakr or men like him. It is not even known that he killed anyone like this. These men strove to kill him (i.e. to kill the Amir al-Mu`minin `Uthman) and Muhammad attacked him with them. He did not command that they be killed in order to protect himself, so why would he instigate the execution of someone whose blood was protected?<br />
<br />
  17. Something similar happened in the time of `Umar as al-Baladhari related in `The Conquest of the Lands' (p. 448, pub. 1350) and Ibn Hajar in the `Isaba' (3:358, pub. in 1328).<br />
<br />
  18. Ibn Taymiyya said in `The Path of the Sunna' (3:189), &quot;If `Uthman had commanded that Muhammad b. Abi Bakr be killed, he deserved to be obeyed more than those who sought to kill Marwan because `Uthman was an Imam of guidanc and a rightly-guided  Khalif who must put his people in order and kill those whose evil can only be  averted by execution. As for those who sought to  kill Marwan, they were kharijite people who were corrupting the earth. They did not have the right to kill anyone nor to carry out any hadd-punishment. Marwan was no nearer to sedition and evil than Muhammad b. Abi Bakr. Ibn Abi Bakr was not more famous in knowledge and the deen than Marwan. The people of the Sahih volumes related a number of hadith from Marwan. He spoke with the people of fatwas. They disagree about whether he was a Companion. Muhammad b. Abi Bakr did not have this position with the people, furthermore, Marwan was one of the associates of Ibn az-Zubayr, etc.&quot;<br />
They must seek their right against Marwan and others (from him). It is firm that he executes and takes. He empowers the person who takes his right. In addition to his precedence, excellence, and position, nothing is proven against him to necessitate that he be dismissed, let alone killed.<br />
<br />
  19. The Amir al-Mu`minin `Ali b. `Abi Talib described them in a similar way in the speech in which he addressed the new men in his army in Kufa when the warrior of jihad and Companion, al- Qa`qa' b. `Amr at-Tamimi was seeking to finish the task which `A'isha, Talha and az-Zubayr had sought to complete. At-Tabari related (5:194) that `Ali mentioned Allah's blessing to the community through agreement on the Khalif after the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the next one after him and the next one after him. He said in the presence of those who had murdered `Uthman, &quot;Then this event took place. It was brought on the community by certain people who desired  this world. They envied  the excellence Allah had given him and wanted to reverse things.&quot; Then he mentioned that he would travel the next day to Basra to meet with the  Umm al-Mu`minin and his brothers Talha and az-Zubayr. He said, &quot;None should travel tomorrow to assist `Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, with anything in any of the matters of the people. Let the fools protect themselves from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
  20. We already summarised the characteristics of those who attacked `Uthman. The first to uncover their secret and look at their faces with the light of Allah and think ill of them was that man of Islam, the transmitter of hadith, Amir al-Mu`minin `Umar b. al-Khattab. He had perspecacity which did not err. At- Tabari related (4:86) that when `Umar reviewed the armies for jihad in 14 A.H., the tribes of the Yemeni inhabitants passed before him with Kinda. They were led by Husayn b. Numayr as- Sakuni and Mu`awiya b. Hudayj, one of the Comapnions who conquered Egypt and later was one of its governors. `Umar did not like them. There were some young men among them with dark lank hair. He turned away from them and then he turned  away again and turned away a third time, until he was asked, &quot;What is wrong between you and those men?&quot; He said, &quot;I am doubtful about them. None from the Arabs has passed by me which I disliked more than them.&quot; They included Safwan b. Haran abd Khalid b. Miljam. Both of them were among those who attacked `Uthman.<br />
<br />
  21. He is Ghafiqi b. Harb al-`Ukki, one of the sons of the nobles of the Yemani tribes who stayed in Egypt after it was conquered. When Ibn Saba` appeared with his partisanship for `Ali and did not find a breeding-place for his occupation in the Hijaz, nor in Syria, he contended himself with placing some helpers in Basra and Kufa. He chose to reside in Fustat. This al- Ghafiqi was one of his recruiters. They won him over by means of his desire for leadership and rank. Muhamamd b. Abi Hudahyfa b. `Utba al-Ummawi was the fosterling of `Uthman al-Abiq. He was his right hand in carrying out the plans of the Saba'ites in Egypt. Al-Ghafiqi was in charge of dispatch and venegeance. In Shawwal of 35 A.H., they made their preparations to advance from Egypt to Madina with four groups of men who numbered  about six hundred altogether. There was a leader in charge of every group. Their general leader was this al-Ghafiqi. They pretended that they were intending to go on Hajj. In Madina, their agitations developed until the business got out of control and they prevented `Uthman from praying with the people in prayer (at-Tabari, 5:107). When Shaytan induced them to undertake the greatest crime, al-Ghafiqi was one of those who dared to do it and struck `Uthman with a sword he had and struck the Qur'an with his foot and turned it around (at-Tabari, 5:130). After the murder of `Uthman, Madina remained for five days while its Amir was al-Ghafiqi b. Harb (at- Tabari 5:155).<br />
<br />
  22. This was also one of the recruiters of Ibn Saba' in Egypt. When `Uthman sent `Ammar to Egypt to investigate the rumours and to ascertain the real situation, the Saba'ites won him over. Kinana b. Bishr was one of them (at-Tabari, 5:99). When the mobs from the tribes gathered to attack Madina under the pretext of the Hajj in Shawwal of 35 A.H., they split up into four groups in Egypt. Each group had an Amir. Kinana b. Bishr was the Amir of one of these groups (at-Tabari, 5:103). Then he was in the front of those who attacked the house of `Uthman, holding a torch (soaked in naphata), in his hand. he entered by the house of `Amr b. Hazm and the torches were carried in after him, (at-Tabari, 5:123). Kinana at-Tujibi  reached `Uthman and stabbed him with a broad arrowhead and blood splashed on the ayat, &quot;Allah will be enough for you against them,&quot; (at-Tabari, 5:131). Muhammad  b. `Umar al-Waqidi said, `&quot;Abdu'r-Rajman b. al-Harith b. Hishan  al- Makhzumi al-Madini (died 43 A.H.) said, `The one who killed the Amir al-Mu`minin `Uthman was Kinana b. Bishr b. `Attab at-Tujibi, (at-Tabari, 5:132). Al-Walid b. `Uqba b. Abi Mu`ayt said on it:<br />
Isn't the best of creation after the three, <br />
the one who was murdered by the Tujibi who came from Egypt?<br />
Kinana was to be slain in the war which broke out in Egypt in 38 A.H. between Muhammad b. Abi Bakr as-Siddiq, the representative of `Ali and `Amr b. al-`As and men from the army of Mu`awiya b. Hudayj as-Sakuni (at-Tabari, 6:51-59 and 60).<br />
<br />
  23. As-Sakuni, one of the tribes of Murad of Yemen who stayed in Egypt. It was already stated that in 14 A.H. he was one of those who came during the khalifate of `Umar to do jihad with the  armies of the Yemen under the leadership of Husayn b. Numayr and Mu`awiya b. Hudayj. When the Amir al-Mu`minin reviewed  them, his glance fell on Sawdan b. Hamran and his colleague Khalid b. Miljan. He felt that there would be calamity from them and so he disliked them. When the Amir al-Mu`miin `Uthman sent `Ammar to Egypt to investigate the source of the false rumours and ascertain the real situation for him, the Saba'ites embraced `Ammar.<br />
Sawdan b. Hamran was one of them, (at-Tabari, 5:99). When the Saba'ites moved the volunteers in the sedition from the Yemani mobs in Egypt during Shawwal of 35 A.H. towards Madina and they divided them into four groups, Sawdan was the leader of one of those groups, (at-Tabari,  5:103). When these rebels reached Madina and Muhammad b. Maslama went out to them to stress the right of `Uthman and to point out that they were bound by the homage which they had given to him, he saw that they followed four men. This man was one of them, (at-Tabari, 5:118). In 5:131 of `The History' of at-Tabari, he described how Sawdan and some others scaled the wall from the house of `Amr b. Hazm to reach the house of `Uthman. In 5:130, there are some of the details of what Sawdan did when they committed the terrible crime. When they finished murdering the Amir al-Mu`minin, Sawdan left the house shouting, &quot;We have killed `Uthman b. `Affan!&quot; (at-Tabari, 5:123).<br />
<br />
  24. His father was an aged man among those who became muslim at the conquest of Makka. `Abdullah b. Budayl will be mentioned in the sedition against the Amir al-Mu'minin `Uthman. At-Tabari (5:124-125), mentioned that al-Mughira b. al-Akhnas b. Shariq ath-Thaqafi, the ally of the Banu Zuhra, went out with `Abdullah b. az-Zubayr, Marwan and othes to defend the Amir al-Mu'minin at the door of his house. `Abdullah b. Budayl attacked al-Akhnas b. Shariq  and killed him. Ibn Hajar transmitted in his biography in the Isaba (2:280) from Ibn al-Kalbi that `Abdullah b. Budayl and his brother `Abdu'r-Rahman were present at Siffin with `Ali and killed there. It is clear that his brother was killed before him. Ibn Hajar transmitted in the Isaba (2:281) from Ibn Ishaq in the `Kitab al-Firdaus' that when `Ubaydullah b. `Umar b. al-Khattab came to Kufa, (i.e. with the army of the people of Syria), he met `Abdullah b. Budayl. Ibn Budayl advised him not to shed blood in this sedition. `Ubaydullah used the excuse that he was seeking to avenge the blood of the Amir al-Muminin and that Uthman had been wrongly murdered. Ibn Budayl offered the excuse that he was seeking revenge for the blood of his brother who had been wrongly killed. How could his brother have been wrongly killed when he was killed in a sedition in which he had voluntarily participated of his own free will while `Uthman, who was the Amir al-Mu'minin and ruled them by right, was attacked by Ibn Budayl, men like him and those who were less important than him. In spite of that, `Uthman did not fight anyone and he did not defend himself. He forbade people to defend him against the mob who had come to the city of the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from the different lands to perpetrate evil.<br />
Where is `Abdu'r-Rahman b. Budayl who is practically unknown in history, in relation to `Uthman whose good deeds filled the heaven and earth?<br />
<br />
   25 Hukaym b. Jabala al-`Abdi was  from the tribes of the `Abdu'l-Qays. Their root was in Oman and the coasts of the Persian Gulf. He lived in Basra after it was settled. This Hukaym was a brave young man. The Islamic armies which set out towards the west to spread the call and conquest came from Basra and Kufa. Hukaym b. Jabala accompanied these armies and risked himself in one of the dangerous attacks just as commandos do now. The armies of the Amir al-Mu'minin `Uthman used him in one of these operations in its attempt to conquer India. The shaykhs of Sayf b. `Umar at-Tamimi (who is the most famous of the historians of the history of Iraq) confirmed  what at-Tabari quoted from him (5:90), i.e. that when the armies returned Hukaym b. Jabala was among them, he went into Persia and changed the people of the Dhimma for the worse and alienated them. He corrupted things in the land, took what he wanted and then came back. Both the people of the Dhimma and the people of the Qibla complained to Uthman. `Uthman wrote to `Abdullah b. `Amir that he sould jail him and those like him. They were not to be allowed to leave Basra until right guidance could be seen in them. They jailed him (i.e. kept him from leaving Basra). When `Abdulalh b. Saba' came to Basra, he stayed with Hukaym b. Jabala and some individuals gathered to him and he spat his poison into them. From there, Ibn Saba' travelled to Fustat and remained there. He began to correspond with them. Some of them disgreed. <br />
At-Tabari (5:104) mentioned that when the Saba'ites decided to advance from the cities against the city of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, the number of those who came from Basra  was the same as the number that came from Egypt. They were also divided into four groups. The Amir of one of these groups was Hukaym b. Jabala. They stopped at a place called Dhu Khashab. Then they threw pebbles at the Amir al- Mu'minin while he was speaking on the mimbar of the Prophet. Hukaym b. Jabala was one of them (at-Tabari, 5:106). When the rebels travelled from Madina the first time after their debate with `Uthman and listening to his defence and being **************************** with it, they left al-Ashtar and Hukaym b. Jabala behind in Madina (at-Tabari, 5:120). That indicates a strong suspicion that they could have entered into the business of fabricating the letter ascribed to the Amir al-Mu'minin.<br />
When `A'isha, Talha and az-Zubayr came to Basra and were about to reach an agreement with the Amir al-Mu'minin `Ali to put things in order, Hukaym b. Jabala was the one who started the fighting so that the understanding and agreement would not be completed (at-Tabari, 5:176 et seq.). He vilely murdered a woman from his own people. She had heard him reviling the Umm al-Mu'minin, `A'isha and she said to him, &quot;Son of a wicked woman, you are more suited to that!&quot;. So he attacked her and killed her (at-Tabari, 5:179). Then his people withdrew from helping him except for some fools among them. He continued to fight until his foot was cut off. Then he was killed. All those who were in the battle from those who had attacked `Uthman were killed. The herald of az- Zubayr and Talha called out in Basra, &quot;Whoever has anyone in his tribe who is one of those who attacked Madina, should bring him to us.&quot; They were brought as dogs are brought and then killed. The only one who was missed among them was Harqus b. Zuhayr as- Sa`di, one of the Banu Tamim (at-Tabari, 5:180). `Amr b. Hafs related from his shaykhs that he said, &quot;A man from al-Haddad struck the neck of Hukaym b. Jabala. He was called Dukhaym. Hukaym's head hung down attached by the skin an his face turned around to the back of his neck (at-Tabari, 5:182).<br />
<br />
  26. From an-Nakh'. That is a Yemani tribe from the tribes of Mad-haj. He was a grave hero and one of the heroes of the Arabs. his first military battle was at Yarmuk. He lost one of his eyes in it. Then he wanted to unsheathe his sword against his brother muslims in the sedition. If he had not been one of those who conspired against the Amir al-Mu'minin `Uthman and if Allah had written that his military  battles were for the spread of Islam and to widen the conquest, he would have had another position in history. That which moved him to this course was his excess in the deen, and his love of leadership and rank. I do not know how they were both joined in him. Al-Ashtar was one of those who took Kufa as their place of residence. When al-Walid b. `Uqba was Amir over Kufa, al-Ashtar felt himself worthy of leadership and government. He erred with those who criticised the state and its men right from the highest Khalif in Madina down to his governor over Kufa, al-Walid b. `Uqba. When Abu Zaynab and Abu Mawra' stole al- Walid's ring from his house and took it to Madina and then testified that al-Walid had drunk wine as has been already stated, al- Ashtar and others rushed to Madina to enlarge the area of the sedition. When `Uthman dismissed al-walid for Sa`id b. al-`As, al-Ashtar returned with Sa`d to Kufa (at-Tabari, 5:63). `Uthman had established a system for the transfer of lands. Whoever had some land from the booty in a place which was far from him could change it for land closer to him with the consent of the two who made the transfer. By this means, Talha b `Ubaydullah renounced his shares in Khaybar and used them to purchase some of the booty of the people of Madina in Iraq. That was land called an-Nashasaj, (at-Tabari, 5:56). While Sa`id b. al-`As was in the house of the amirate in Kufa with some people a man praised Talha b. `Ubaydullah for his generosity. Sa`d b. al-`As said, &quot;If I had the like of the land of an-Nashasaj, I would let you live a life of plenty  for Allah.&quot; `Abdu'r-Rahman b. Khumays al-Asadi said to him, &quot;I wish that you had al-Miltat.&quot; Al-Miltat was some land on the side of the Euphrates which had belonged  to the family of Chosroes. Al- Ashtar and his companions becme angry. They said to the Asadi, &quot;You wish that he had some of our good land!&quot; His father said, &quot;He wants the double of it for you. &quot; Al-Ashtar and his companions attacked the Asadi and his father and beat them in the assembly of the Amir until they fainted. The Banu Asad heard about that and came and surrounded the castle to defend their men. Sa`id b. al-`As stopped this strife and turned to Banu Asad away from al-Ashtar and his group. The nobles of Kufa and their men of right action wrote to `Uthman to ask him to expel these troublemakers from their land. He sent them to Mu`awiya in Syria (at-Tabari, 5:85-86). Then  Mu`awiya expelled them and they came to the peninsula of Ibn `Umar. They were in the custody of `Abdu'r-Rahman b. Khalid b. al-Walid  until they showed regret. Then al-Ashtar went to Madina to tell `Uthman of their repentance. `Uthman was pleased with him and allowed him to go wherever he liked. He chose to return to his colleagues who were with `Abdu'r-Rahman  b. Khalid b. al-Walid in the peninsula (at-Tabari, 5:87-88). While he was telling `Uthman that he and his colleagues had repented in 34 A.H., the Saba'ites in Egypt  were corresponding with their agents in Kufa  and Basra. They told them to rebel against their Amirs and to make ready for a certain day. Only the groups situated in Kufa did that. Yazid b. Qays al-Arhabi stirred them up (at-Tabari, 5:101).<br />
When al-Ashtar came to Madina to his brothers who were with `Abdu'r-Rahman b. Khalid b. al-Walid, he found that they had received a letter from Yazid b. Qays al-Arhabi. It said, &quot;Come as soon as you put down this letter.&quot; They felt uneasy about this summons and preferred to remain where they were. Al-Ashtar opposed them and returned as a rebel after his repentance. He joined the rebels of Kufa  who had alighted at al-Jar'a, a place overlooking Qadisiyya. There  they met Sa`d b. al-`As, the Amir of Kufa, when he was returning from Madina and turned him back. Al-Ashtar met a client of Sa`d b. al-`As. Al-Ashtar struck his neck. It reached `Uthman that they wanted to dismiss Sa`d for Abu Musa al-Ash`ari and he gave them what they had asked for (at- Tabari, 5:93-94). When the date in 34 A.H. proved unsuccesssful and the sedition was confined to what took place in al-Jar'a, the Saba'ites prepared for the year after it (35 A.H.). They arranged  things so that they went to Madina with the hajjis as if they were going on Hajj. Al-Ashtar was one of the leaders of the Kufa group. He was in charge of one of their four groups (at-Tabari, 5:104). After they reached Madina, the Amir al-Mu'minin `Uthman debated with them and made his proof clear to them in all that they thought. Most of them were satisfied with his position and forced the leaders of the sedition to be **************************** with `Uthman's answers. They travelled  from Madina and they did not travel with them (at-Tabari, 5:120).<br />
When the Egyptians reached a place called al-Buwayb, a rider stopped them, playing the part of the bearer of the alleged letter. The story about that will come later. At-Tabari (5:194) mentioned that al-Ashtar was involved in the plot of the Saba'ites which they had hatched before `Ali travelled from Kufa to Basra trying to reach an understanding with Talha, az-Zubayr and `A'isha. The Saba'ites decided in their plot to start the war between the two parties before peace could be made between them. In the Battle of the Camel, `Abdullah b. az-Zubayr and al-Ashtar fought and they exchanged blows. `Abdullah b. az-Zubayr said his famous words, &quot;Kill me and Malik!&quot;. Al-Ashtar got away from him. At-Tabari related (5:217) from ash-Sah`bi that people did not know al-Ashtar by the name of Malik. If Ibn az-Zubayr had said, &quot;Kill me and al-Ashtar,&quot; and al-Ashtar had had a million men, none of them would have been saved. He continued to give way  before Ibn az-Zubayr until he managed to slip away. At-Tabari related (5:194) that when `Ali finished the oath of allegiance after the Battle of the Camel and appointed `Abdullah b. `Abbas over Basra, al-Ashtar  heard that `Ali had appointed Ibn `Abbas. He became angry and said, &quot;For what did we kill the old man then?! Yemen is for `Ubaydullah, the Hijaz is for Quthum, Basra is for `Abdullah and Kufa is for `Ali!&quot; Then he called out, &quot;Departure!&quot; and rushed off and caught up with `Ali. He did not tell `Ali what he had heard. He said, &quot;What is this journey? You have gone ahead of us?&quot; Then al-Ashtar participated in the war of Siffin and `Ali appointed him over Egypt after Qays b. Sa`d b. `Ubada left it. When he reached Suez, he had a drink of honey and died. It was said that the honey was poisoned. That was in 38 A.H.<br />
<br />
  27. They stirred up the sedition on the day when they beat up `Abdu'r-Rahman b. Khunays al-Asadi and his father while they were in the house of the Amir in Kufa. The nobles and men of right action of Kufa wrote to `Uthman asking him to expel them to another land. Then he sent them to Mu`awiya in Syria. Those who were sent to Mu`awiya were: al-Ashtar an-Naka'i, Ibn al-Kiwa al- Yashkari, Sa`sa`a b. Sawhan al-`Abdi, his brother Zayd, Kumayl al-Azdi, Thabit b. Ways b. Munaqqa', `Urwa b. al-Ja'd al-Bariqi, and `Amr b. al-Humq al-Khuza`i.<br />
<br />
 28. The text of what Mu`awiya said is as is found with at-Tabari (5:86), &quot;You are people from the Arabs. You have ears and tongues. You have obtained nobility by Islam. You have conquered the nations and you have taken their positions and their inheritance. It has reached me that you resent the Quraysh. If it were not for the Quraysh, you would have been considered abased as you were before. They are your Imams up until today and your shelter, so do not hinder your shelter. Your Imams are patient with you in injustice and bear the trouble from you. By Allah, you will cease or Allah will try you with one who will be hard on you. Then He will not praise you for patience. Then you will share with them in what you brought upon the populace while you were alive and after your death.&quot;<br />
<br />
  29. The killer was his brother Sa`sa`a.<br />
<br />
 30. He also said to Mu`awiya, &quot;As for what you mentioned of the shelter, when the shelter is pierced, then come to us.&quot; i.e. when we kill our governors, we will be the rulers. <br />
<br />
  31. The answer Mu'awiya gave to the words of Sa`sa`a in the descripiton of Quraysh and its position is lengthy and precious. At-Tabari quoted it (5:86).<br />
<br />
  32. The speaker might say, &quot;Do not the events which occurred in the tragedy of the martyrdom of the Khalif `Uthman indicate his negligence since he did not know what was happening in the secret conspiracy of the plotters?&quot;<br />
In reality, in spite of his occupation with the vast conquests which were completed in his time, this Khalif was not unaware of the plots which were hatched against him in order deceitfully to harm Islam. As far as the events themselves were concerned, he was free of any suspicion of weakness repeated by his opponents. <br />
The historian, Muhammad `Izza Daruza said, &quot;Ibn Sawda (i.e. `Abdullah b. Saba') and his groups worked to spread the call against `Uthman and his Amirs until they englarged their base, as has come in the transmission of at-Tabari. They wrote secret letters and sent them to the people in the cities. That reached the poeple of Madina and they went to `Uthman to ask him whether he had heard what had reached them from the cities. He told them, &quot;By Allah, only peace has come to me, so tell me what it is.&quot; Then he told them, &quot;You are my partners and the witnesses of the believers. Give me advice.&quot; They  indicated that he should send certain individuals who were trustworthy to the cities to tell the people that neither his notable men nor the common people objected to anything that `Uthman had done. The Amirs were just to the people  (at-Tabari, part 3, p. 379).<br />
Then he wrote a general letter to the people of the cities in which he mentioned what he had heard about the rumours and the attacks on the Amirs.  He said, &quot;The Amir al-Mu'minin is appointed to undertake to command the correct and forbid the objectionable. He appoints his governors to do that. He is prepared to listen to every complaint about himself and about his governors and to give justice to the one with the complaint and give everyone with a due his due.&quot; He summoned anyone with a complaint to come to him in the Festival (pp. 380-381). At-Tabari quoted that from `The History of the Arab Race' (7:231). Then he summoned the governors of the cities and asked them for news about the affair. He  said, &quot;I fear that it will be proven against you.&quot; They assured him that they were following the oath of the truth and correct behaviour, and that what he had heard was nothing but intrigue and whisperings spread by stealth. One of them proposed that the propaganda agents be punished and executed. He commanded his governors to be prudent, compassionate and indulgent as long as that did not entail the loss of the rights of the community. One of the governors was Mu`awiya b. Abi Sufyan (from `The Arab Race', 7:232. He quoted at-Tabari.) The historians mentioned that `Uthman gathered some of his elite and consulted them about the business of this people. He listened to them and then he said to them, 'I have heard all that you have pointed  out to me. Every business has a door. This business which is feared for this community is still hidden and its closed door can be opened. We will hold it back by leniency and by being obliging, except in the hudud of Allah. If the door opens, no one will have proof against me. Allah knows that I have treated the people well. If the millstone of sedition turns around, then `Uthman will have bliss if he dies without being the one to move it.&quot; The people were silent when he gave them their rights. When the rights of Allah are damaged, are they to be lax? (`The Khalif Lied Against', p. 64, by Muhammd Sadiq `Urjun).<br />
One of the clearest proofs of the strangth of `Uthman and his self-composure was his position when the rebels and people of the sedition were intense in their attack on him. They attacked him in his house to kill him while the great valiant Companions and their sons wanted to defend him as we stated elsewhere. He ordered everyone who thought that `Uthman was owed obedience to restrain their hands and throw away their weapons. This was due to his solicitude for the blood of the muslims, even if that involved offering his life to death and to murder. <br />
Would that I knew what personal courage and what patience people could seek beyond this! If courage is self-control in calamities without any apprehension, steadfastness in adversities without anxiety, and firmness in great misfortunes  without being shaken, the sources could not avoid someone like `Uthman in his courage, self-composure, the strength of his certainty, and firmness in his opinion. No one in a situation similar to that which `Uthman was in would endure the like of what `Uthman endured, not even part of it. No one could endure the affliction and trial as `Uthman endured it. How could someone endure something which would lead him to being murdered with full knowledge and insight? If he had been fearful and had wanted to do anything other than endure that, with both certainty and ****************************ment, he had means by which he could have  escaped and lived in comfort. However, `Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, was neither weak nor abject, as is claimed by those who are incapable and negligent. He was strong in iman, great in certainty, high-minded, with great courage, noble in patience, and piercing in insight. He ransomed the community and established its greatest supports of order in social formation. (`The Khalif Lied Against' by M.S. `Urjun, p. 65).<br />
<br />
  33. Ibn al-Kiwa said in what Ibn `Asakir quoted in his biography of the History of Damascus (7:299) and Abu Ja`far at-Tabari quoted in his History (5:92), in describing the people of misdeeds: the people of Madina are the most free from  evil in the community and the most incapable of it. As for the people of misdeeds from the people of Kufa, they are the ones who most frequently dwell on small wrong actions although they commit the greatest wrong actions. As for the people of misdeeds from the people of Basra, they rejected every one and went out in separate groups. As for the people of misdeeds from the people of Egypt, they are both the people with the fullest portion of evil and the quickest to repent. As for the people of misdeeds from the people of Syria, they were the people who were  the quickest to obey their guide and rebel against the one who would misguide them.<br />
<br />
  34. He wrote about them to `Uthman. &quot;Some people have come to me who have neither intellect nor deen. Islam burdens them and justice vexes them. They do not aim for Allah in anything nor do they speak by any proof. They are concerned with sedition and taking the property of the people of the Dhimma. Allah is the One who will test and try them. They are those who injure people. Restrain Sa`id and those with him. They do not have the most strife or repugnant behaviour.&quot; (at-Tabari, 5:87)<br />
<br />
  35. He was appointed over Hums for Mu`awiya and the area of the peninsula, Harran and ar-Ruqqa. <br />
<br />
 36. That was after he said to them, &quot;Tools of Shaytan! You have no welcome! Shaytan has returned in sorrow and yet you are still  active! May Allah disappoint `Abdu'r-Rahman if he does not discipline  you until he makes you feel regret! Oh company of a people whom I do not know to be arab or non-arab, you will not say to me what I heard that you said to Mu`awiya. I am the son of Khalid  b. al-Walid. I am the son of one who was tested by the teeth. I am the son of the one who knocked out the Ridda. By Allah, Sa`sa`a, if I were to hear that any of those with me had broken your nose and then given something to you, I would have made you fly down an abyss (at-Tabari, 5:87).<br />
<br />
  37. Whenever he rode, he made them walk. When he passed by Sa`sa`a, he said, &quot;Son of a mean woman, don't you know that the one who is not put right by by good is put right by bad? Why do you not tell me what I heard that you said to Sa`id and Mu`awiya?&quot; They said, &quot;We repent to Allah. Release us, may Allah release you!&quot; (at-Tabari 5:87-88)<br />
<br />
  38. The one who went to the Amir al-Mu'minin `Uthman in Madina was al-Ashtar an-Nakh`i alone. He is the one who represented the sons of  Sawhan, Ibn al-Kiwa and others, in restating their earlier repentance with `Abdu'r-Rahman b. Khalid  b. al-Walid. However, the sedition was not confined to these men. It originated with Ibn Saba' who chose to reside in Fustat. It had a branch in Basra. Al-Ashtar and his brothers left some men in Kufa. While al-Ashtar was in Madina restating his repentance and the repentance of his brothers, the  agents of Ibn Saba were writing to Basra and Kufa to set the time to attack their brothers in Kufa calling them to  participate in the plot. Only al-Ashtar, who had not yet even forgotten his repentance, was happy about that summons to sedition and evil. He sped to Kufa and joined the sedition which history calls &quot;The Day of al-Jar'a.&quot; That was in 34 A.H.<br />
<br />
  39. When the Saba'ites were unsuccessful in their attack on their governors in 34 A.H. on the sedition  of the Day of Jar'a, they plotted another sedition with a wider area. They set it for the following year (35 A.H.) when the hajjis were preparing to go from Egypt, Basra, and Kufa to Madina and Makka. The hajjis went on Hajj to obey Allah, but the propagandists of the sedition went to declare rebellion against Allah. They had organised themselves into twelve groups: four groups from Egypt, four from Basra, and four from Kufa. There were about 150 deluded people in each group, i.e. about 600 men from every city.<br />
<br />
  40. i.e. To the  Amir al-Mu'minin `Uthman in the city of the Messenger of Allah bless him and grant him peace.<br />
<br />
 41. The warrior poet. He stayed (in Egypt), with the conquering army. It is not known that he was distinguished by anything other than his participation in this sedition, even though he claimed that he was one of those who took the Pledge of the Tree. I do not think that he was one of the leaders who organised the sedition. However, their organisers took advantage of his desire for leadership. They made use of his age and rank among the warriors of the Arab tribes of Egypt. They appointed him to lead one of the four groups which left Egypt for Madina. The leaders of the other three groups were: Kinana b. Bishr at-Tujibi, Sawdan b. Hamran as-Sukuni, and Qutayra as-Sukuni. Their supreme leader was al-Ghafiqi b. Harb al-`Ukki. During the seige, `Abdu'r-Rahman b. `Udays was very cruel towards the Amir al-Mu'minun `Uthman and the people of his house. He ended by being killed at Hebron, close to Hums. A bedouin met him. When he admitted that he was one of `Uthman's  murderers, the bedouin leapt up and killed him. (`The Collection of the Land' by Yaqut: Hebron) Whoever said that Ibn `Udays was related to Tujib made a mistake. He was a Balawi from Quda'a. As for Tujib bint Thawban al-Madh-hajiyya, only the sons are ascribed to her and `Adi, the sons of Ashras b. Shubayb b. as-Sukun from Kinda. Where is Kinda in relationship to Quda'a?<br />
<br />
  42. The informatin was already given earlier. He was the Amir of one of the four groups from Basra  (the three others were Dhurayh b. `Abbad al-`Abdi, Bishr b. Shurayh &quot;al-Hatm&quot; and Ibn al-Mahrash al-Hanafi. Their supreme leader was Harqus b. Zuhayr as Sa`di).<br />
<br />
 43. He was already mentioned earlier. He was the Amir of one of the four groups of Kufa. The three others were: Zayd b. Sawhan al-`Abdi, Zihad b. an-Nadr al-Harithi and `Abdullah b. al-Asamm. Their supreme leader was `Amr b. al-Asamm.<br />
<br />
  44. They lighted three stages outside of Madina. Then the rebels of Basra advanced and camped at Dhu Khashab. The rebels of Kufa camped at al-A'was. Most of them camped at Dhu'l-Marwa.<br />
<br />
  45. It is like that in the Algerian edition (2:117). Perhaps he erred and the correct version is the &quot;seventh&quot; as in &quot;The History' of at-Tabari (5:107). It is said that that was the position of the Sura Yunus in the Qur'an of Ibn Mas`ud, according to what is in `The  Fihrist' of Ibn an-Nadim (p.39, published in Egypt).<br />
<br />
  46. The discussion on the hima has already been given.<br />
<br />
  47. i.e. They made five or six stipulations with the following meanings. <br />
<br />
 48. Those who came from their cities against the city of the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, consisted of two groups: the deceitful leaders and their deluded followers. They were many. Biased propaganda had spread among them until they believed that there actually were exiles who had been wronged, deprived, individuals who had been stripped of their rights, etc. You have already seen the testimony of the two most truthful witnesses in Iraq at that time: al-Hasan al-Basri and his brother Ibn Sirin. They testified to the abundance of gifts, provisions and various blessings in `Uthman's time when people were summoned to accept them. He did not refuse anyone. You already saw the testimony of Imam ash-Sha`bi regarding general provision and bounty, even for slaves. When the rebels  heard `Uthman's answers and recognised the truth, they were satisfied and retreated. They went home by different routes since their cities lay in opposite directions. The Egyptians headed for the northwest so as to travel along the coast of the Red Sea to Suez and Egypt. The Iraqis, both the Basrans and Kufans, headed northeast in order to go by the Najd highlands to Basra and Kufa in Iraq.<br />
<br />
 49. i.e. While the Iraqis from Basra and Kufa were on their way to the northeast and the Egyptians were on their way towards the northwest, and while there were many stages between the two groups because they had already been travelling for some time  and were very far from each other, <br />
<br />
  50. He only stopped them so that they would look at him. He deliberately made them suspicious of him. This is what those who had employed this man wanted. He was meant to play this role. The organisers of this plot wanted to rekindle the sedition after Allah had quelled it and relieved the Muslims of their evil. It would not be reasonable to assume that this drama could originate with `Uthman, Marwan or any man connected with them because they would not profit by rekindling the sedition after Allah had averted it. Those who stood to benefit by that were the first propagandists who wanted to provoke this strife. They included al-Ashtar and Hukaym b. Jabala who did not travel with their people. They had remained behind in Madina (at-Tabari 5:120). The only reason for them to remain in Madina would be to conspire and take these measures. It was their sole desire. <br />
<br />
 51. The reports which have come on it state  that the rider was `Uthman's slave, and that the camel was one of the zakat camels, and that `Uthman admitted that. These are all mursal reports whose speaker is unknown, or else they are lies spread by those whose truthfulness and trustoworthiness are doubted. The riwayats are confused regarding the ****************************s of the letter. One of the riwayts had, &quot;When `Abdu'r-Rahman b. `Udays comes to you, flog him 100 times, shave his head and beard, and imprison him for a long time until my command comes to you. Do the same to `Amr b. al-Humq, Sawdan b. Hamran, and `Urwa b. an-Nabba' al-Laythi.&quot; One version has, &quot;When Muhammad b. Abi Bakr as-Siddiq and so-and-so and so-and-so comes to you, kill them and consider their document invalid. Remain in your post until my opinion comes to you.&quot; A third version says that the ****************************s of the letter commanded his governor to kill them, cut off their hands, and crucify them as rebels. This disagreement about the ****************************s of the letter increases its doubtfulness. <br />
<br />
  52. The most extraordinary thing is that the caravans of the rebels which were far from each other in the east and west returned together to Madina at the same time, i.e. the caravans of the Iraqis which had been many stages away form the caravans of the Egyptians, learned through this staged transmission at the very same moment in which the drama was being played out in al- Buwayb. They returned to Madina at the very moment that the Egyptians returned. They reached Madina together as if it had been arranged. This means that those who hired  the rider to play the role of the bearer of the letter for the caravans of the Egyptians, also hired another rider  to leave Madina  with him to go to the caravans of the Iraqis to inform them that the Egyptians had discorved a letter which `Uthman had sent to `Abdullah b. Sa`d in Egypt, ordering him to kill Muhammad b. Abi Bakr. At- Tabari said (5:104), &quot;`Ali said to them, `How did you learn, people  of Kufa and people of Basra, what the people in Egypt had found when you had travelled  several stages? Now you come back to us? By Allah, this is a matter which was fabricated in Madina!&quot; He, may Allah ennoble his face, indicated  that al- Ashtar and Hukaym had remained  in Madina, and they were responsible for this drama. The Iraqi rebels said, &quot;Take it however you like. We do not need this man. Let him leave us.&quot;  They admitted that the letter was forged and that their first and last desire was to depose the Amir al-Mu'minun `Uthman and to shed his blood, although Allah had protected him by the Shari`a of His Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.<br />
<br />
  53. At-Tabari (5:108). All the riwayats agree about this conversation between `Ali and the rebels. It is definite strong text showing that the hand which forged the letter against `Uthman  and informed the Iraqis about it and asked them to return to Madina was the same hand which forged the letter ascribed to `Ali and sent it to the Iraqi rebels, asking them to return. We already  said (no. 143) that the rebels were in two groups: deceiving and deceived. Those who were deluded looked at each other when `Ali swore that he had not written to them. They wondered how it could be that `Ali had not written  to them when his letter had reached them. Who had written the letter ascribed to him if he had not written it? You will learn that Masruq b. al- Ajda` al-Hamdani (who was one of the notable Imams of guidance) censured the Umm al-Mu`minun `A'isha for writing to people to command them to come out against `Uthman. She swore to him by Allah, in whom the believers believe and whom the rejectors reject, that she had not written anything to them. Sulayman b. Mahran al-A`mash, one of the great Imams said, &quot;They thought that it was written and then ascribed to her.&quot;<br />
Oh Muslims of this age, the criminal hands who forged the false letters ascribed to `A'isha or `Ali and Talha and az-Zubayr are the same hands which organised all of this iniquity. They are the ones who cooked up the sedition from the beginning to the end. They are the ones who forged the so-called letter ascribed to the Amir al-Mu`minun `Uthman, addressed to his Governor in Egypt at the moment when he knew that he did not have a Governor in Egypt. They forged the letter which was ascribed to `Uthman with the same pen they used to forge the other letter ascribed to `Ali. All of that was done in order to make the rebels return to Madina after they had been **************************** with the soundness of the position of their khalif and satisfied that what had been spread about him was all lies and they were assured that he acted in every matter according to what he thought to be true and good.  The in-law of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, (who had given him the good news of martyrdom and the Garden) was not the only one harmed by this foul Saba'-ite conspiracy. Islam itself was injured. The pure history which generations of muslims learned was distored and twisted. Those generations were among those injured by that foul jew and those who surrendered to him in their passion and appetites. <br />
<br />
  54. Because they did not come to accept the truth or to refer to the Shari`a. They came either to depose him or to shed his blood. <br />
<br />
55. That which was already stated is that they had bound themselves not to leave the community nor part from the community.</div></div><hr />
