<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StraightPath</div><div class="date">05-07-03, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jabir reported that he heard Imam Baqir saying: 'No one can claim that he has compiled the Quran as Allah revealed except a liar. The only person to compile it and memorise it according to its revelation was Ali ibn Abi Talib and the Imams who succeeded him. (Usul Kafi: 1:228)<br />
<br />
A man said that someone was reciting the Quran in the company of Imam Ja'far. The narrator said that he heard certain verses in the recitation which were not according to the recitation of the people. Imam Ja'far told the person reciting: 'Do not recite like this. Recite as the people recite until the (promised) Mahdi arrives. When the Mahdi arrives, he will recite the Quran according to its original revelation and the Qu,ran compiled by Ali will be brought forward. (Ibid: 2.622)<br />
<br />
Allah says in Surah Ale Imraan (32):<br />
&quot;Certainly Allah has chosen Adam, Noah, the family of Abraham and the family of Imraan above the (families of the) worlds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allamah Ali ibn Ibrahim AI-Qummi - one of the early Shi'ite commentators of the Quran said concerning this verse:<br />
<br />
'The Imam said: 'The words: &quot;The family of Muhammed&quot; were also revealed along with &quot;the family of Ale Imraan.&quot; They (referring to the Companions of the Prophet S.A.W.) removed the words &quot;The family of Muhammad&quot; from the original text (Al-Qummi's commentary:308). The allegation of removing the words preempts any possibility of abrogation. It is clear that the commentary is accusing the Companions of the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) of distorting the Quran.<br />
<br />
Allah says in Surah Taha (115): <br />
And We had given Adam an order before, but he forgot and We did not find any resolve in him (to disobey the order).&quot;<br />
<br />
Imam Ja'far is reported to have said that Allah had revealed this verse with the following words:<br />
<br />
&quot;We had ordered Adam before with some words about Muhammad, Ali, Fatima, Hassan, Hussain and the Imams from their offspring but he (Adam) forgot.&quot; Ja'far said: 'By Allah, these were the words which were revealed to Muhammad.' (Usul Kafi: 1:416 and the footnotes of Maqbool's translation: 637)<br />
Allah says in Surah Yusuf (49):<br />
Then a year will come in which people will be given abundant help and they will press grapes.&quot; In AI-Qummi's commentary it is reported from Imam Ja'far that someone recited this verse in the presence of Ali. Ali said: 'What will they press'? Wine?' The person asked how he should read the verse. Ali replied that the verse was revealed thus: &quot;Then a year will come in which people will he given abundant help and in which they will be given abundant rain. (Al-Qummi's commentary: 192)<br />
The word Ya'siroon in the present Quran is in the active voice. According to this commentary it should have been read in the passive voice as Yu'saroon to alter the meaning. In the footnotes to the translation of Maqbool, it is written that this word (Ya'siroon) was changed from the passive voice to the active to suit the fancies of wine-loving khulafa (rulers). (Maqbool's translation: 479)<br />
<br />
Allah says in Surah Muhammad (9):<br />
That is because they resented what Allah revealed, so Allah in turn cancelled their deeds.&quot; AI-Qummi has stated that Imam Muhammad Baqir said that Jibreel had transmitted this verse as: 'That is because they resented what Allah revealed about Ali.' But then the apostates removed Ali's name (from the Quran). (Ibid: 1011)<br />
<br />
Allah says in Surah Waqi'ah (29):<br />
&quot;And the Companions of the Right Hand. What about the Companions of the Right Hand. They shall be among thornless lote-trees and under clusters of bananas.&quot;<br />
<br />
One person recited this verse in the presence of Ali. Ali said that the word Talh is not.appropriate and should read Tal'a as in Surah Shu'araa (.........). Some enquired as why the word should not be changed. Ali replied that it was not the right time to do so because correcting the Quran would only confuse common people. He went on to say that among the Imams, only Imam Mahdi will have the right to reintroduce the Quran as it was during the time of the prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). (Ibid: 1067)<br />
<br />
Abu Mansur Ahmed Tibrisi, a prominent Shi'ite scholar of the 8th century (H), has written<br />
<br />
'Enumerating the distortions and omissions of this sort (from the present Quran) would become laborious and it will disclose what Taqiyyah (Shi'ite practice to conceal the 'truth' for religious purpos<br />
es) requires me not to disclose: the good qualities of Allah's friends and the vices of His enemies. (AI-Ihtijaj by Tibrisi: 1:254)<br />
Mullah Muhsin Kashani, an 11th century Shi'ite scholar comments on the above quoted statement:<br />
<br />
'It is clear from all of these traditions and quotations from the Family of the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) that the present Quran is not the complete Quran which was revealed to the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam). In fact, there are verses that contradict that which was revealed; verses that have been distorted and places where omissions have been made such as the names of Ali, the Family of Muhammad (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and, on several occasions, there were the names of the hypocrites. Moreover, the present order of the Quran is not according to the preferred order of Allah and His Messenger. Ali ibn Ibrahim (a renowned commentator) also holds this opinion.' (Tafseer of Saafi: l:32)<br />
<br />
Please note that references that were used, are major shia references, which they see equivilent to Saheeh Al Bukhari and Tafseer Ibn Katheer.<br />
It is not hard at all to find such statements in their books, however a common problem with the shias is that they hardly read their own books and perfer to blindly follow their scholars, so may Allah swt guide the sincere ones among them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and Allah said in surah Al-Anaam, ayah 115 &quot; The word of thy Lord doth find its fulfilment in truth and in justice: None can change His words: for He is the one who heareth and knoweth all &quot;<br />
<br />
as u mentioned that they prefer to follow their scholars, which they said that the present Quraan is not complete Quraan  which was revealed to the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), and they also said only Imam Mahdi will have the right to reintroduce the Quran as it was during the time of the prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam), why they donot prefer to follow these two ayahs which i mentioned before?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">«·ÕÃ«Ã</div><div class="date">14-07-03, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jazakillah for your input Sis<br />
<br />
Actually they do believe in the verses you've quoted. However; they have their own explanation to justify their beliefs. For example<br />
<br />
&quot; We have, without doubt, sent down the Message; and We will assuredly guard it (from corruption)&quot; i.e We'll guard it by Imam Al-Mahdi. Hence, when a Shi'ite swear to God that s/he does not believe in the distortion of the Qur'an or that the Qur'an is incomplete, s/he actually means the version that was written by Ali n was passed down to Al-Mahdi. The muslim will foolingly believe him/her cuz s/he took an oath, not knowing s/he can give you the impression that the oath is based on what you have in mind, but actually s/he has some~else. Actually, the Shi'ite can even swear in vain if that supports his/her stand, based on their philosophy of Taqiyyah (Tuqyah)</div></div><hr />
