<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">«·√⁄‘Ï</div><div class="date">28-07-03, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shias make tha claim that Fadak was a gift to Fatimah -RA-, given to her by the Prophet -sala Allahu Alyhi Wa Salaam- . To make their claim appear true to Sunnis, they use some Sunni sources to prove it:<br />
<br />
Ahmad Tha'labi in his Kashfu'l-Bayan; Jalalu'd-din Suyuti in his Tafsir, vol. IV, reporting from Hafiz Ibn Mardawiyya; the famous commentator Ahmad Bin Musa (died 352 A.H.) reporting from Abu Sa'id Khadiri and Hakim Abu'l-Qasim Haskani; Ibn Kathir; Imadu'd-din Isma'il; Ibn Umar Damishqi; Faqih-e-Shafi'i in his Ta'rikh, and Sheikh Sulayman Balkhi Hanafi in his Yanabiu'l-Mawadda, ch. 39, reporting from Tafsir-e-Tha'labi, Jam'u'l-Fawa'id and Uyunu'l-Akhbar - all narrate that when the verse &quot;and give to the near of kin his due&quot; was revealed, the Holy Prophet of Allah called Fatima and bestowed the great Fadak upon her as a gift. <br />
<br />
 But all of these narrations meet on a single chain: &quot;Fudayl Ibn Marzooq from Atiya from Abu Saeed.&quot; So let's investigate their integrity:<br />
<br />
Fudayl Ibn Marzooq [From Tahtheeb Al-Tahtheeb]:<br />
<br />
Ahmad said: &quot;I only know good of him&quot; and &quot;he almost only narrated from Atiya&quot;<br />
<br />
Al-Nasai said: &quot; He is weak (Dhaeef)&quot;<br />
<br />
Ibn Hiban said: &quot;He used to commit mistakes and he narrates from Atiya fabrications&quot;<br />
<br />
And as you can see this narration is from Atiya.<br />
<br />
Atiya Al-Awfi[From Tahtheeb Al-Tahtheeb]:<br />
<br />
 Al-Bukhari said: &quot;Ali told me: from Yahya: Atiya and Abu Harun and Bishr Ibn Harb are all of the same status to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ahmad said: &quot; He is weak&quot; and &quot; It reached me that Atiya used to come to Al-Kalbi and ask him about Tafseer, and he used to give him the nickname (Kunya) of Abu Saeed, and then he would relate: Abu Saeed said&quot; and &quot; Abu Ahmad Al-Zubairi told me that he heard Al-Kalbi say:  Atiya gave me the kunya of Abu Said.&quot; <br />
<br />
Al-Nasai said:&quot; He is weak&quot;<br />
<br />
Ibn Hiban said:&quot; He heard from Abu Saeed hadiths and when he died he used to sit to Al-Kalbi, so if Al-Kalbi said: The Messenger of Allah ñsala Allahu Alyhi Wa Salaam- said such and such he would memorize it and he gave him the kunya of Abu Saeed and narrated from him. So if it is said to him: Who narrated this to you? He would say: Abu Saeed narrated this to me. So they (i.e those who inquired) would think that he meant Abu Saeed Al-Khudri, when in reality he meant Al-Kalbi.&quot; And &quot;It is not permissible to write his narrations except for being amazed about it.&quot; And then he related from Khaled Al-Ahmar that he said: &quot; Al-Kalbi told me: Atiya told me: I have given you the kunya of Abu Saeed so I say: Abu Saeed narrated to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you can see, Abu Saeed in this chain is not named as Al-Khudri and this narration is considered part of Tafseer. Accordingly Abu Saeed in this narration is Al-Kalbi and not the companion of the Prophet ñpbuh- Abu Saeed Al-Khudri.<br />
<br />
Abu Saeed: Muhammad Ibn Al_Sae'b Al-Kalbi:<br />
<br />
Al-Suyuti said in AL-Itqan regarding the Tafseer of Ibn Abbas ñ RA -: &quot;And the weakest of its chains is the way of Al-Kalbi from Abu Saleh from Ibn Abbas. And if the narration of Muhammad Ibn Marwan Al-Sadi, the young, is added then this is the chain of lies, and quite often Al-Thalabi and Al-Wahidi narrate through it. Ibn Adi said in Al-Kamel : Al-Kalbi has some good narrations, especially through Abu Saleh, and he is known for Tafseer, and no one has Tafseer longer than his and more thorough than his, and second to him is Muqatil Ibn Sulayman, but Al-Kalbi is preferred over him for the bad beliefs of Muqatil.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yaqut Al-Hamawi said in Mu'jam Al-Udaba regarding the Tafseer of Al-Tabari: &quot; And he did not make reference to any untrusted Tafseer, for he did not include in his book anything from the book of Muhammad Ibn Al-Sa'eb Al-Kalbi nor Muqatil ibn Sulayman nor Muhammad ibn Umar Al-Waqidi for they are create suspicion(athina') in his view and Allah knows best.&quot; <br />
<br />
Al-Bukhari mentioned in his Tarikh Al-Kabeer: &quot;Muhammad Ibn Al Sae'b Abu Al- Nadhir Al-Kalbi was abandoned by Yahya Ibn Saeed, Ibn Mahdi and Ali told told us: Yahya Ibn Saeed told us: from Sufyan: Al-Kalbi told me: Abu Salih told me: everything I have told you is lies.<br />
<br />
Al-Nasai said: He is not trusted and his hadith should not be written.<br />
<br />
Ahmad Ibn Harun said: &quot;I asked Ahmad Ibn Hanbal about Tafseer Al-Kalbi. He said: lies. I said: is it permissible for me to look into it. He said: No.&quot;<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION: This narration has no credibility at all. As for the other narrations were she ñRadia Allahu Anha- herself claimed that the Prophet ñpbuh- gave her Fadak, then all the narrations end at people who have not met the companions of the Prophet ñpbuh- such as Awana Ibn Al-Hakam, Musa Ibn Uqba, Zayd Ibn Ali, and they too cannot be given credibility for this reason and for some weakness of narrators in the chain too.<br />
<br />
Authentic reports tell us that Fadak remained in the hands of the Prophet ñpbuh- until he died:<br />
<br />
Bukhari, Volume 9, Book 92, Number 408: <br />
<br />
Narrated Malik bin Aus An-Nasri: <br />
<br />
I proceeded till I entered upon 'Umar (and while I was sitting there), his gate-keeper Yarfa came to him and said, &quot; 'Uthman, 'Abdur-Rahman, Az-Zubair and Sa'd ask your permission to come in.&quot; 'Umar allowed them. So they entered, greeted, and sat down. (After a while the gatekeeper came) and said, &quot;Shall I admit 'Ali and 'Abbas?'' 'Umar allowed them to enter. Al-'Abbas said &quot;O Chief of the believers! Judge between me and the oppressor ('Ali).&quot; Then there was a dispute between them. 'Uthman and his companions said, &quot;O Chief of the Believers! Judge between them and relieve one from the other.&quot; Umar said, &quot;Be patient! beseech you by Allah, with Whose permission the Heaven and the Earth Exist! Do you know that Allah's Apostle said, 'Our property is not to be inherited, and whatever we leave is to be given in charity,' and by this Allah's Apostle meant himself?&quot; On that the group said, &quot;He verily said so.&quot; 'Umar then faced 'Ali and 'Abbas and said, &quot;I beseech you both by Allah, do you both know that Allah's Apostle said so?&quot; They both replied, &quot;Yes&quot;. 'Umar then said, &quot;Now I am talking to you about this matter (in detail) . Allah favored Allah's Apostle with some of this wealth which He did not give to anybody else, as Allah said: 'What Allah bestowed as Fai (Booty on His Apostle for which you made no expedition... ' (59.6) <br />
<br />
So that property was totally meant for Allah's Apostle, yet he did not collect it and ignore you, nor did he withhold it with your exclusion, but he gave it to you and distributed it among you till this much of it was left behind, and the Prophet, used to spend of this as the yearly expenditures of his family and then take what remained of it and spent it as he did with (other) Allah's wealth. The Prophet did so during all his lifetime, and I beseech you by Allah, do you know that?&quot; They replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; 'Umar then addressed 'Ali and 'Abbas, saying, &quot;I beseech you both by Allah, do you know that?&quot; Both of them replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; 'Umar added, &quot;Then Allah took His Apostle unto Him.&quot; <br />
<br />
So as we see, both Al-Abbas and Ali ñRA-, as well as the other companions witnessed that the property remained in the hands of the Prophet ñpbuh- until he died. And this strengthens the point that the Prophet ñpbuh- did not give it to Fatima as a gift, since if he did he would not have used the money on other dependants such as his wives because it has not become his property anymore. Furthermore, one who is familiar with the Seerah of the Holy Prophet ñSala Allahu Alyhi Wa Salaam- would realize that he lived a life of piety and asceticism. He used to get a lot of bounty from the battles one, yet he used to spend them all in the way of Allah, leaving only what is required for absolute necessity with him. Even protecting his precious skin from the strips of the rough mat he used to lie did not constitute a necessity for him that he would buy a soft mat for himself. He would leave the congregation after prayer has been called for to rush to his room and not delay spending seven dirhams that, he forgot and were all what remained in that day, in the way of Allah. And so he died leaving no dirham, and no dinar and his shield was mortgaged to a Jew for a few handfuls of wheat to feed his house-hold. He truly lived that words of wisdom that he spoke: &quot;What does this life (Dunya) have to do with me. I am in this life like a stranger or one who is passing buy resting in the shade of a tree.&quot; He also wanted his family members to live a similar life, not attached to this world and not collecting any wealth. Consider the following hadith:  <br />
<br />
Bukhari, Volume 8, Book 75, Number 330: <br />
<br />
Narrated 'Ali: <br />
<br />
Fatima complained about the blisters on her hand because of using a mill-stone. She went to ask the Prophet for servant, but she did not find him (at home) and had to inform 'Aisha of her need. When he came, 'Aisha informed him about it. Ali added: The Prophet came to us when we had gone to our beds. When I was going to get up, he said, &quot;'Stay in your places,&quot; and sat between us, till I felt the coolness of the feet on my chest. The Prophet then said, &quot;Shall I not tell you of a thing which is better for you than a servant? When you (both) go to your beds, say 'Allahu Akbar' thirty-four times, and 'Subhan Allah' thirty-three times, 'Alhamdu 'illah' thirty-three times, for that is better for you than a servant.&quot; Ibn Sirin said, &quot;Subhan Allah' (is to be said for) thirty-four times.&quot; <br />
<br />
So notice, dear brother and sister, how the Prophet ñ Sala Allahu Alyhi Wa Salaam- did not give Sayyida Fatima ñRadia Allahu Anha ña servant even though she was in desperate need for it, having blisters in her hands from the hard work. One would never ever think of her requesting a servant because of wanting to live a lavish life, but rather for a desperate need. But still, the Prophet ñ Sala Allahu Alyhi Wa Salaam- refused her a servant. This is nothing compared to a vast property such as Fadak!! <br />
<br />
If we were going to depend on weak narrations to prove our claims, then we might as well use the following:<br />
<br />
Narrated by Ibn Saad in Al-Tabaqat Al-Kubra that Jafar Ibn Muhammad Al-Ansari said:&quot; Fadak was an exclusive bounty for the Messenger of Allah ñsala Allahu Alyhi Wa Salaam- so it was for the wayfarer (Ibn Al-Sabeel) and his daughter asked him to give her Fadak as a gift, so the Messenger of Allah ñSala Allahu Alyhi Wa Salaam- refused, so nobody wished for it etc&quot; <br />
<br />
I am not using this narration as a basis to prove the point, for the authentic hadith mentioned earlier would suffice but I use this against those who hurl weak and dubious reports about the Prophet ñSala Allahu Alyhi Wa Salaam- giving Fadak to Fatima. Since as it seems they do not mind to used weak narrations so let them consider this one too.</div></div><hr />
