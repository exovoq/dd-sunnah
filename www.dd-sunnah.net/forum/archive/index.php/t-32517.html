Situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran <br />
<br />
Note by the Secretary-General<br />

=====<br />
<br />
Situation of certain religious minorities<br />
<br />
50. In his report to the 1998 session of the Commission on Human Rights, the Special Representative expressed his view on what constitutes a minority by referring to the definition set out some years ago by Special Rapporteur Francisco Capotorti.c This definition is at odds with the view of the Iranian Government that religious minorities are defined constitutionally in the Islamic Republic of Iran, and that its constitutional definition does not, for example, encompass the Sunnis or certain other groups. The Special Representative continues to believe that in the Islamic Republic of Iran, groups meeting the Capotorti definition face discrimination - in some cases religious and in others ethnic or linguistic. He had hoped to pursue the matter in the course of a visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran, but the absence of the cooperation of the Government in this regard precluded this.<br />
<br />
51. As regards the general subject of minority rights, the Special Representative wishes to draw attention to the latest Commission on Human Rights resolution thereon, namely Commission resolution 1998/18 entitled &quot;Implementation of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief&quot;, adopted on 9 April 1998.<br />
<br />
52. According to information coming to the Special Representative's attention from Zoroastrian and Christian sources in particular, even the recognized minorities believe they face discrimination in civil society. Allegations include the difficulty of obtaining government employment; the requirement placed upon shops to have a window sign reading, &quot;Designated for religious minorities&quot;, which, officially, should apply only to food shops in the context of halal food, but which in practice is used to discourage Muslim customers; and the awarding of substantial damages in automobile accident claims if the driver was a person of a religious minority and the victim a Muslim but very low awards for cases where the reverse obtains. More generally, it is asserted that all minorities, especially religious minorities, are by law or practice barred from being elected to a representative body (except as regards the reserved seats in the Majlis), from becoming a school principal and from holding senior government or military positions.<br />
<br />
53. In his last report to the General Assembly (A/52/472, of 15 October 1997), the Special Representative commented on the allegations he had received from Sunni sources, particularly the Baluch, concerning the destruction of Sunni schools and mosques, and the imprisonment, execution and assassination of Sunni leaders. Some of these allegations were and are quite specific. There are also charges of socio-economic discrimination and repression, and transmigration policies that risk turning the Baluch into a minority in their traditional lands.<br />
<br />
54. The Government has made it clear that it does not regard the Sunnis, as fellow Muslims, to be a minority in Iranian society nor are they discriminated against owing to their beliefs. The Special Representative has been further informed that there are at least one judge and one provincial governor, and six or eight members of the Majlis, who are Sunnis.<br />
<br />
55. The Special Representative is satisfied that the Sunni community and the Baluch in particular may well be subject to unacceptable treatment and he calls upon the Government to address the situation as a systemic problem rather than insist upon the details of particular incidents.<br />
