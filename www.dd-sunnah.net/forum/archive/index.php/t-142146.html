<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ÈäÊ ÃÈæåÇ</div><div class="date">29-12-11, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since I have noticed, a lot of Muslims unfortunately celebrate Christmas. So, I have decided to write about it.<br />
As a Muslim, I believe in Jesus (PBUH) as a Prophet of God, and NOT the Son of God. This occasion should not be marked as a <br />
<br />
holiday we celebrate, especially us Muslims.Nevertheless, we, as Muslims, respect Jesus as a righteous Prophet of God. The Quran describes Christian people as believers in God who are often &quot;devoted to learning... have renounced the world, and they are not arrogant.&quot;<br />
<br />
There are several reasons for not celebrating this occasion:<br />
1. Christians celebrate the 25th of December because they think it's the birth date of Jesus (PBUH). However, some people <br />
<br />
think this date is wrong because of a verse in the Holy Quran that states: &quot;And shake towards you the trunk of the palmtree, <br />
<br />
it will drop on you fresh ripe dates&quot; (Quran 19: 25).<br />
Ripe dates do not grow in the middle of winter! They actually grow in the middle of the summer.<br />
<br />
2. Even if He was born on December 25th, we, as Muslims, don't believe in him as Son of God. We only believe in him as a <br />
<br />
Prophet and Messengar of God. Allah says in the Quran: &quot;And they say: The Beneficent God has taken (to Himself) a son. <br />
<br />
Certainly you have made an abominable assertion. The heavens may almost be rent thereat, and the earth cleave asunder, and <br />
<br />
the mountains fall down in pieces, That they ascribe a son to the Beneficent God. And it is not worthy of the Beneficent God <br />
<br />
that He should take (to Himself) a son.There is no one in the heavens and the earth but will come to the Beneficent God as a <br />
<br />
servant.&quot; (Quran 19:88-93).<br />
<br />
3. Some Christians do not celebrate Christmas merely for relegious reasons. It's part of their culture as well. In our relegion and culture, we have our own days when all Muslims over the world celebrate. Christian people do not celebrate our own days since it's not part of their relegion nor cultlre.<br />
