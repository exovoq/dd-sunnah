[Answer]: It is itrati/ahlu bayti in the hadeeth of Thaqalayn, which the Prophet ñpbuh- mentioned in Ghadeer Khum. However, at mount Arafa and in the last sermon the Prophet ñ pbuh- was reported to have said: ì I have left with you two matters (amrayn), you will not be misguided if you hold fast to them: the Book of Allah and my Sunnah, and they will not separate until they meet me on the Pond.î <br />
 <br />
We notice that the Prophet ñpbuh- mentioned the narration of my Sunnah in a larger gathering, were people from all over Arabia witnessed what he said. Since it is the greater Sunnah, which also includes Ahlul Bayt, that all people would benefit from along with the Book of Allah. In Ghadeer Khum, which is on the way between Mecca and Medina only those who were heading to Medina joined him, and thus it was appropriate that he would ask people to take care of the people of his household, those who cannot receive Sadaqa, since the people of his house-hold reside in Medina:<br />
 <br />
ìOne day Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood up to deliver sermon at a watering place known as Khumm situated between Mecca and Medina. He praised Allah, extolled Him and delivered the sermon and. exhorted (us) and said: Now to our purpose. O people, I am a human being. I am about to receive a messenger (the angel of death) from my Lord and I, in response to Allah's call, (would bid good-bye to you), but I am leaving among you two weighty things: the one being the Book of Allah in which there is right guidance and light, so hold fast to the Book of Allah and adhere to it. He exhorted (us) (to hold fast) to the Book of Allah and then said: The second are the members of my household I remind you (of your duties) to the members of my family. He (Husain) said to Zaid: Who are the members of his household? Aren't his wives the members of his family? Thereupon he said: His wives are the members of his family but the members of his family are those for whom acceptance of Zakat is forbidden. And he said: Who are they? Thereupon he said: 'Ali and the offspring of 'Ali, 'Aqil and the offspring of 'Aqil and the offspring of Ja'far and the offspring of 'Abbas. Husain said: These are those for whom the acceptance of Zakat is forbidden. Zaid said: Yes.î - narrated by Muslim<br />
Question: Is it true that Sunnis have given deaf ears to the Prophetís ñsala Allahu Alyhi Wa Salaam- advice of holding to his utraí and thus we find that they narrate so little from Ahlul-Bayt?<br />
Answer: Holding to the utraí was not mentioned in the correct version of the hadeeth of thaqalayn, but rather the general advice to take care of the Prophet ñsala Allahu Alyhi Wa Salaam-ës house-hold, and this Ahlu-Sunna hold too, as it is clear from Abu Bakr ñRA-ës statement: ì It is more beloved to me to keep good relations with the relatives of the Messenger of Allah ñ sala Allahu Alyhi Wa Salaam- than my own relatives.î And Ahlu- Sunnah respect Ahlul- Bayt all of the righteous and good of them and not only twelve of them. <br />
<br />
As for the narrations, then if we compare what Ahlu-Sunnah narrate from the companions of the Prophet ñsala Allahu Alyhi Wa Salaam- who were Caliphs and those who were from Ahlul Bayt we noticed, by looking at Musnad Imam Ahmad, that he only narrated about 500 hadiths for Abu Bakr ñRA- , Omar ñRA- and Othman ñRA- combined and the narrations of Ali ñRA- by himself are more than 700, thus the rulers out of the companions of the Prophet ñpbuh- constitute a small amount of the narrations in Sunnah. In fact a much much greater amount of the Sunnah  comes through Ahlul- Bayt (Aisha, Umm Salamah, Hafsah, Ali, Hassan, Abdullah Ibn Abbas, Zaynul-Abedeen, Muhammad Al-Baqer, Jafar Al-Sadeq ñ may Allah be pleased with them-) than from narrations of rulers amongst the companions who are not from Ahlul-Bayt (Abu Baker, Umar, Uthman, Muawiya -  may Allah be pleased with them-) <br />
<br />
And the reason why Ahlul Sunnahís narrations from Ahlul Bayt seem much less than what the Shia report is that Ahlul Sunnah do not accept any narration about Ahlul Bayt except from authentic narrators as opposed to the dubious sources of the Shia, who narrate anything from Ahlul Bayt and famous narrators from Shia were renown for reporting lies about Ahlul Bayt, as Imam Jafaar himself confessed in their own books.</div></div><hr />
