Graduated as a doctor by USP specialist on thorax surgery, Ryoki left medicine in 1986 to become a writer. In a short period, he ruled 95% of all the pocket books published in Brazil.<br />
<br />
He wrote 999 great tales across six years, together with stories, about farwest, war, cops, spying, love and science fiction. <br />
When he, in 1992, suggested to his publishers an improving in the brazilian¥s pocket book graphic appearance, got astonished with the carelessness all of them showed about his project. It wasn¥t interesting for any publisher to get his books in condition to reach a really brain-worked public target, do not mention it to compete in a international market.<br />
<br />
He gave up than, the pockets to devote himself right to bigger books, better worked ones in the literary purpose and with a higher graphic quality. But Ryoki faced another problem: no brazilian printing-office could breath while publishing and distribute his phenomenal production: about six new titles a month.<br />
<br />
Ryoki Inoue has been a target of the main newspapers and magazines all around the world, from &quot;Veja&quot;, &quot;Isto&amp;Eacute;&quot;, &quot;Manchete&quot;, &quot;O Estado de S&amp;atilde;o Paulo&quot;, Jornal do Brasil&quot;, &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The N.Y. Times&quot;, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, &quot;Lire&quot; and a sort of others, as has been interviewd by TV channels like &quot;Rede Globo&quot;, &quot;SBT&quot;, &quot;Cultura&quot;, &quot;Bandeirantes&quot;, &quot;Nippon Television Network&quot;, and others. Due his vehment and long Literary production, since 1993, Ryoki Inoue places the International Guinnes Book of Records, as the man who most wrote and published books all around the planet.<br />
<br />
When he got to the score of a thousand books, with ìE Agora, Presidente?î (prefaced by the journalist Alexandre Garcia), Ryoki decided for a changing on his literary career, leaving behind the pocket books and starting writing bigger romances, published with his own name. His subjects are simply everything, life, day-by-day, social discussions, histories about ordinary people and not so ordinary people.<br />
<br />
When seeing Ryoki in the Guinness Book, Matt Moffett, american journalist of the Wall Street Journal, got his curiosity awaken to the writerís creations process, wanting to see to believe, how someone to produce successful stories in such a small time could. So, he defied the writer and came to S&amp;atilde;o JosÈ dos Campos (where Ryoki used to live that time), by the end on January 1996. A week latter, Moffett told was born Ryokiís book ñ Sequestro Fast Food, created in one night, more necessarily from 23h30 to 4h ñ in one of the most famous newspaper in the world.<br />
<br />
With 1.075 books, from his own hands, published, his compulsory production didnít stop ever. Sometimes, he used to write three romances a day, working all night on. <br />
<br />
In his opinion, the secret of the creative process is in 98% of sweat, 1% of talent and 1%of luck. Moreover, discipline and application are the motive that make him to be sit in front of his computer and donít leave until the end of his new job.<br />
<br />
Ryoki didnít stop writing: he produced several romances, worked as a ghost writer to famous people, wrote ************************s and, with the objective to perfect his knowledge on the spying field ñ obviously to make better romances ñ he dedicated during three years on the research and studying of Competitive Intelligence and he make innumerable books and articles translations for companies of this branch.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, Ryoki Inouesís objective is to produce a romance a year, two in maximum. <br />

Charles Hamilton (writer)<br />
Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - Cite This Source<br />
<br />
<br />
Charles Harold St. John Hamilton (August 8 1876 ñ December 24 1961), also known as Frank Richards, was an English children's-book author.<br />
<br />
Born in Ealing, he is listed in Guinness World Records as the most prolific author of all time with a lifetime output calculated at 72-75 million words.<br />
<br />
Much of his work was published in the weekly boys' papers of the time, and at times he was writing at least six stories each week, using over twenty different pen-names.<br />
<br />
He is most famous for his work as Frank Richards for the weekly story paper The Magnet, but he also wrote weekly tales of Tom Merry and Co. of St Jim's for The Gem (as Martin Clifford), Jimmy Silver and Co. of Rookwood School for The Boys Friend Weekly and of the Rio Kid in The Popular (as Ralph Redway), and Bessie Bunter of Cliff House for The School Friend (as Hilda Richards, supposedly Frank Richards' sister, though &quot;Hilda&quot; only wrote 6 issues of that paper). Also Jack Nobody/Jack Free in Spring Books: &quot;Jack's the Lad&quot; and &quot;Jack of the Circus&quot;.<br />
<br />
His most famous creation is Billy Bunter, who featured in stories set in Greyfriars School. The Billy Bunter stories were serialised in The Magnet from 1908 until the paper shortage during World War II ended its publication in 1940. After World War II Hamilton wrote a number of Bunter books, which were published by Charles Skilton and Cassells. He also wrote the ************************s for the BBC's Billy Bunter television series starring Gerald Campion, which ran from 1951 to 1961.<br />
<br />
In the 1970s Howard Baker began to publish facsimiles of every issue of The Magnet; he fell just short of completing the series at the time of his death in 1991. <br />
