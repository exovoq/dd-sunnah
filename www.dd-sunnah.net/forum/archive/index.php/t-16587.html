Dear Muslim Brothers and Sisters in Islam, below is some of the lies that Shi'ites say about their 12 Imams, as some of you might have already known that the Shi'ites are different in many aspects of Islam..... But I'll tell you that the Shi'ites are Not Muslims since they insult Islam with all of their superstitions and lies about their 12 Imams, here are some of the many things that the Shi'ites say about their Imams. (please read all the other articles on shi'ites on this site)<br />
<br />
&quot;All the Imams are infallible just like the prophets. The Shi'ites derive their religion from their immaculate Imams&quot; (Ibid, p. 22) Well this is a clear statement of kufr from the Shi'ites, as you can see they admit that they derive their religion from their Imams, well this means that if a Shi'ite Imam made something that in the Qur'an was lawful, forbidden, the Shi'ites would follow their Imams... by this statement the Shi'ites have taken themselves outside Islam.<br />
<br />
&quot;By listening to the voice of a person, the Imams can tell if the person was destined to go to hell or to heaven; they would thus answer his questions accordingly&quot; (Usool al Kafi, p. 185) Dear Brothers and Sisters, as you can see the Shi'ites make their Imams out to be some God-like being, can't they see that this is Shirk (worshipping other than Allah, or associating partners with him).<br />
<br />
&quot;The Imams possess all the knowledge granted to angels, prophets and messengers&quot; (Al-Kulaini, Al-kaafi, p.255.) Well here is more shirk from the Shi'ites... How can an Imam, who is just a human, know the Unseen??? Only Allah knows the Unseen, and think about this... The Imams were not even Alive at the time of all of the prophets so here is a major contradiction in the Shi'ite faith!<br />
<br />
&quot;The Imams know when they will die, and they do not die except by their own choice&quot; (Ibid, p: 258.) Now, this is a clear statement of kufr. Only Allah knows when a man will die! And these Shi'ites say that their Imams can control when they die?? This is major kufr and shirk for any one to believe in all the things that the Shi'ites say about their Imams!<br />
<br />
&quot;The Imams have knowledge of whatever occurred in the past and whatever will happen in the future, and nothing is concealed from them&quot; (Ibid, p. 260.) Subhanallah!! Only Allah knows the future for any person to say that these Imams know the Unseen is committing Shirk and takes himself outside Islam.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Imams have knowledge of all the revealed books, regardless of the languages in which they were revealed&quot; (Ibid, p. 227.) As you can see these Shi'ites have elevated their Imams to a God-like level, and the Shi'ites say that there is nothing wrong with this!!! Now can we see why the Shi'ites are different to us muslims!<br />
<br />
&quot;No one compiled the Qur'an completely except the Imams, and they encompass all of its knowledge' (Ibid, p. 228) So since the Qur'an was not compiled by the Imams then does that mean that the Quran is fabricated????? These Shi'ites want to even destroy Islam... look at what they say, they even insult the Qur'an!! And it is a well known fact that the Shi'ites have their own Qur'an (On this web site we have an article all about the false lies that the Shi'ites put in their own so called Qur'an).<br />
<br />
&quot;Signs of the prophets are possessed by the Imams&quot; (Ibid, p. 231.) The Shi'ites have once again elevated their Imams to a very high level. The Imams they refer too are only human! So why do the Shi'ites worship them.<br />
<br />
&quot;When the Imams' time comes, they will rule in accordance with the ruling of the prophet David and his dynasty. These Imams will not need to ask for presentation of evidence before passing their judgments&quot; (Ibid,p. 397.) The Shi'ites even think that their Imams can do what ever they want!! Here they say that their Imams can just pass judgment on anybody! And they say that their Imams will not rule by the Qur'an but will rule by the laws of David!! (All Muslims must rule by the Qur'an and Sunnah). This is a proof that the awaited Imam of the Shi'ites is not the one that Muslims believe in but he is indeed the Anti-Christ (A'war al-Dajjal). The one that all Jews are waiting for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is not a single truth possessed by a people save that which originated with the Imams, and everything which did not proceed from them is false&quot; (Ibid, p.277.) The Shi'ites have proven themselves to be non-Muslims please dear brothers and sisters look at what these Shi'ites are saying, understand that the Shi'ites are really NOT Muslims!<br />
<br />
Dear Muslim Brothers and Sisters, above is only a small fraction of what Shi'ites say about their Imams... their are many many Shi'ite books claiming the same thing as above about their Imams. So my Brothers and Sisters how can we call these Shi'ites 'Muslim' after what they say about their Imams, If a person worships Idols and does not follow the Qur'an is he a Muslim???? now the Shi'ites worship their Imams and they raise their Imams word over the Qur'an (they say that their Imams word abrogates the Qur'an), so dear Muslims make du'a that Allah guides us on the straight path and exposes the lies that the Shi'ites attribute to Islam, Ameen!</div></div><hr />
