<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
One of the most beautiful things about the concept of worship in Islaam is the truly unique way in which it incorporates the feeling of love, fear and hope within the hearts of the worshippers of Allah. Understanding how to combine these three qualities into the worship (ibaadah) of Allah is one of the most essential things that every Muslim must grasp, not least because every sect which has drifted from the Straight Path has strayed in the aspect of worship. The deviation of the other religions in this regard is clear for all to see: ìGod is love! Jesus is love!î say the Christians, denying the fact that Allah should be feared too. As for the Jews, their hearts were filled only with hope; hope that the Fire will never touch them, since they were the ìPromised Peopleî. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
In Islaam however, no worship is complete without the presence of all three qualities: love of Allah, hope in His Mercy and fear of His Punishment. Contemplate the opening Soorah of the Qur'aan - Soorah al-Faatihah - and you will see this for yourself. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Aayah 1: ìAll praise [and thanks] is for Allah, Rabb of all the worlds.î <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
In this opening aayah (verse) of the Qur'aan, we of Allah and every time we recite this aayah we are testifying to our love for Allah. How is that you ask? <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
It is because in the aayah, we are acknowledging that Allah is our Rabb and the Rabb of all the worlds. Rabb is usually translated as ëthe Lordí, but this translation does not do justification to this name of Allah and all the meanings this name carries. In reality, Rabb means that Allah is the Creator of everything; He sustains and nourishes everything; He gives life and Death; anything good that we have is from Him; everything is dependant on Him and nothing can happen unless He wills it. Furthermore, for the Muslims He - the Rabb - in the One who has guided us to the Truth and given us good morals and manners. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Thus when we testify that Allah is our Rabb, then we are acknowledging that He is the One who has given us so many blessings - so many that if we try to enumerate His blessings, we would be unable to do so. So how could we not but LOVE Him? <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
After all, we all love those who show kindness towards us or present us with gifts. And therefore the Messenger of Allah (salla-allahu alaihe wa-sallam) encouraged the exchange of gifts between Muslims because it helps to strengthen ties and develop love for one another. He (salla-allahu alaihe wa-sallam) said, ìGive gifts to one another, you will come to love one another.î[1] <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
So imagine the LOVE we should have for our Rabb who has given us everything: nice families, shelter, security, food, health and above all the Guidance of Islaam and the Sunnah. We should be overwhelming in our love for Him. That is why we praise Him and thank Him and say, ìAll praise (and thanks) is for Allah, Rabbil-ëaalameen.î <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Aayah 2: The Rahmaan (Merciful) and the Raheem (Mercy-Giving).î <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
In the first aayah of Soorah al-Faatihah, Allah mentioned He was the Rabb. In this aayah two more of His beautiful names are mentioned: ar-Rahmaan and ar-Raheem. Ar-Rahmaan means that He is the Most Merciful. Ar-Raheem means that He is the Giver of Mercy, in other words His actions are full of Mercy and He shows Mercy to His creation.[2] <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
When we mention these two names of Allah, then we have HOPE. Since He is the One who is full of Mercy, and we hope He will forgive our mistakes and shortcomings. We should never loose hope, because Allah says in the Qur'aan, ìO My slaves, who have transgressed against themselves! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, Verily Allah forgives all sins (except sins). Truly He is Oft-Forgiving, the Most Mercifulî [39: 53] <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The need to have FEAR in our worship is shown by the next aayah of Soorah al-Faatihah. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Aayah 3: ìKing/Master of the Day of Judgement.î <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
When we recite this aayah, we remind ourselves of the Day of Judgement - that awful Day, when all of humanity shall stand before Allah Ö naked, uncircumcised and barefooted. People will appear drunk though they are not. On that Day, every person will stand before Allah and account for his sins, knowing that not even the smallest action which he did is hidden from Allah: ìSo whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom shall see it.î [Soorah 99 : 7-8] <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
So when we recite this third aayah of Soorah al-Faatihah, we remind ourselves of this Judgement and accountability and that should bring about in us a sense of fear - that maybe our evil actions will be too great and we will be responsible for them - May Allah protect us from such a fate. Then the next verse goes on to say: ìYou alone we worship.î i.e. we single out Allah for our worship. And how do we worship Him? With LOVE, HOPE and FEAR. And in order to achieve these qualities, we need Allahís assistance, so we say then, ìWe seek Your Aid.î <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Striking the Balance <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
After understanding the need to , hope and fear in our worship, the next question that naturally arises is that, in what proportion should these qualities be present in our worship? Again we turn to the Qur'aan for the answer. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
ìCall upon Him with Fear and Hope.î [ Soorah (7): 56] <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
ìTheir sides forsake their beds, to invoke their Lord in Fear and Hope.î [(32): 16] <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
So both fear and hope should be present in our hearts in equal proportions. Anas reported that the Prophet (salla-allahu alaihe wa-sallam) entered upon a young boy who was dying. The Prophet (salla-allahu alaihe wa-sallam) asked, ìHow are you?î The boy replied, ìO Messenger of Allah, I am in between hoping in Allah and fearing for my sins.î The Prophet (salla-allahu alaihe wa-sallam) said, ìThe like of these two qualities do not unite in the heart of a servant except that Allah gives him what he hopes for and protects him from what he feared.î[3] <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Therefore whenever we do a good action, we should hope that it has been accepted by Allah, but at the same time we should also have fear that maybe it isnít enough or that the good deed has not been worthy of acceptance. Likewise when we sin, we should have hope that Allah will accept our repentance and forgive us, but we should also fear that we may be accountable for it. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
This balance should be reflected in our Dawah (which of course is also worship). So when we invite others to the Truth, we should not give them the impression that ëthey have nothing to worry aboutí, nor do we suggest that ëthey are doomed foreverí. Rather we couple warnings with encouragement. We inform them of the horrors of the Fire and tell them about the bliss of Paradise. Just as we find Allah telling us in the Qur'aan: ìVerily your Lord is Quick in Punishment and verily He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Giver of Mercy.î [(7): 167] <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
And the scholars of Islaam say, ìHe who worships Allah with hope only is a murjiíee. He who worships Him in fear only is a Harooree [Khaarijee]. And He who worships Allah in love only is a Zindeeq [eg. the Soofis, the Christians, etc]. But he who worships Allah in fear, love and hope is a Muwahhid Muímin [a believer upon Tawheed].î[4] <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Murjiía were a sect that emerged within the first century of Islaam. The people of this sect (i.e. the murjiíees) believe that sins do not affect faith i.e. no matter what sins a person commits, his eeman (faith) is complete and perfect. They worship Allah only with hope because they believe that as long as one believed and testified to Islaam, they would enter Paradise regardless of their actions. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, all too often nowadays we find a similar attitude amongst many Muslims today, which is why we find that so often we try to advice someone to turn to the Deen and abandon sin, they just point to their hearts and say, ìAllah knows what is in my heartî, or ìAllah forgivesî, or something else like that. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
As for the Khawaarij, they worshipped Allah in fear only because they held that anyone who commits major sins was a disbeliever and would therefore dwell in Hellfire forever. This of course is gross extremism and straying from the correct path. The Prophet (salla-allahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: ìThere were two men of Banoo Israaíeel who strove equally. One of then committed sins and the other strove hard in worship. And the one who strove in worship cto see the other in sin and kept saying to him: ìDesist.î So one day he found him committing a sin and so said to him: ìDesistî So he replied, ìLeave me by my Lord, have you been sent as a watcher over me?î. He said, ìBy Allah, Allah will not forgive you, nor will Allah admit you to Paradiseî. Then their souls were taken and they came together before the Lord of the Worlds. So Allah said to the one who strove in worship: ìDid you have Knowledge of Me, or did you have any power in what is in my Hands?î And He said to the sinner: ìGo and enter Paradise through My Mercy.î And He said to the other: ìTake him to the fire.î Aboo Hurairah t said: ìBy Him in whose Hand is my soul! He spoke a word which destroyed this world and the hereafter for him.î[5] <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Therefore we should never say of anyone that he or she is a ëlost causeí or ëdoomedí or the like for this is a great sin. However, we fear for those who commit major sins because they have been threatened with punishment in the Qur'aan and the Hadeeth. However it is up to Allah whether He chooses to punish them or whether He will forgive them. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Zindeeqs - or the heretics - are groups, such as many of the Soofis who have become like the Christians and reduced the religion to just ëloveí and so all their talk and their mystical practices are centred around developing more ëloveí. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
It is thus clear how imbalances in any of the three qualities of worship can lead to major deviation and straying to the True Guidance. It is therefore important for every Muslim to combine all three of them in his heart properly. As was mentioned before, the fear and hope should be in equal proportions[6], but as for love then that should be uppermost. As Fudayl ibn-ëIyaad - rahimahullah - (d.187H) said, ìThe love is better than the fear. The fear checks us from sinning, and the love makes us do what is prescribed with an open heart.î[7] <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
May Allah grant us what we hope for and protect us from what we fear. And may the Blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammed, upon his family, his Companions and upon all those who follow Guidance until the Last Day. <br />

[6] This was the opinion of most of the Salaf. Al-Fudayl ibn ëIyyaad said that, when one is healthy and well, then fear should predominate, but when terminally ill then hpoe should predominate - so that one should strive to do good when well and not despair of Allahís Mercy when terminally ill.

Whatever we do Allah Talaa Rahmaan and ar-Raheem, we should not have despair if we knew the meaning of The Eman, of course before dying we ask Allah Talaa to forgive our sins<br />
