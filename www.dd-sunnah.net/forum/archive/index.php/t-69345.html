Quranic Quotations <br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
1- His Miraculous Birth <br />
&quot;And when she (Mary's mother) gave birth, <br />
she said, &quot;My Lord, I have given birth <br />
to a female,&quot; <br />
but God knows what she had given birth to, <br />
a male is not like a female, <br />
&quot;and I have named her Mary, <br />
and I ask You to protect her <br />
and her offspring, from the accursed Satan&quot;. <br />
And her Lord accepted her (Mary), <br />
with gracious favour, <br />
and He caused her to grow up in purity, <br />
Zachariah taking care of her. <br />
When Zachariah used to enter her sanctuary <br />
to see her, he found she had supplies. <br />
He said, &quot;O Mary, how has this come about to you?&quot; <br />
She said, &quot;This is from God, <br />
God provides whoever He wishes, <br />
without measure.&quot;3:36-37 <br />
&quot;And the angels said, &quot;O Mary, God has chosen you <br />
and purified you and chosen you above <br />
the women of all nations. <br />
O Mary, devote yourself to your Lord, <br />
prostrate and bow alongside those who bow&quot;.&quot;3:42-43 <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And the angels said, &quot;O Mary, God gives you <br />
the glad tidings of a Word from Him. <br />
His name is the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, <br />
highly honoured in this world and in the Hereafter, <br />
He shall talk to people when he is in the cradle, <br />
and when he is of old age, <br />
and he will be one of the righteous. <br />
And God will teach him the Book, <br />
Wisdom, the Torah and the Injeel (God's Revelation to Jesus). <br />
And he will be a Messenger to the <br />
Children of Israel, telling them <br />
&quot;I have come to you with a sign from your Lord. <br />
I will create for you <br />
from clay, a figure of a bird, <br />
and when I breathe into it, it will turn into a bird, <br />
with God's permission. I will also cure the blind <br />
and the leper and bring life to the dead <br />
with God's permission. <br />
I will also inform you of what food you eat <br />
and what food you store in your homes. <br />
Surely, in all that there is a sign for you, <br />
if you do believe. <br />
And I came to you to confirm the Truth <br />
of the Torah that was before me, <br />
and to make lawful certain things which <br />
were forbidden unto you. <br />
And I came to you with a sign from your Lord, <br />
so fear God and obey me. <br />
Surely God is my Lord and your Lord, <br />
so worship Him, <br />
as this is the straight way.&quot;3:45-51 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And mention in the Book, <br />
Mary when she withdrew from her people, <br />
to an eastern place, <br />
and she placed a veil apart from them, <br />
We sent her Our angel, <br />
who appeared to her as a person, <br />
totally human. <br />
She said to him, &quot; I take refuge in <br />
the All-Merciful from you, <br />
Come not near if you fear God&quot; <br />
He said, &quot;I am only a Messenger from your Lord, <br />
to announce to you the gift of having a perfect son&quot; <br />
She said, &quot;How shall I have a son <br />
while no human has touched me and I am not unchaste?&quot; <br />
He said, &quot;It will be, your Lord has said <br />
&quot;That is easy for Me and We will make <br />
him a sign (of our creation) to all people, <br />
and a mercy from Us, all is a matter <br />
which has been decreed.&quot; <br />
After she conceived him, <br />
she withdrew with him to a distant place. <br />
And the pains of childbirth drove her to <br />
the trunk of a date-palm, <br />
and she said, &quot;I wished I was dead and <br />
became a forgotten thing before this day.&quot; <br />
But (a voice) cried to her from beneath, <br />
Don't feel sad, <br />
for your Lord has placed a brook at your feet. <br />
And shake the trunk of the date-palm towards you, <br />
fresh ripe dates will drop on you. <br />
So eat, drink and comfort yourself and be glad. <br />
And when you see any human being, <br />
then say, &quot;I have vowed to the All-Merciful <br />
a fast not to talk today to any human being&quot;. <br />
And when she carried him (Jesus) to her people, <br />
they said, &quot;O Mary, you have <br />
surely committed a monstrous thing. <br />
O kinswoman of Aaron, your father was no evil man, <br />
Nor was your mother a woman unchaste !&quot; <br />
So Mary pointed to her child. <br />
They said, &quot;how can we talk to someone <br />
who is a baby in the cradle ?!&quot; <br />
But the baby said, &quot;I am indeed <br />
God's servant and He has given me the Book <br />
and made me a Prophet. And He has made me blessed <br />
wherever I may be, and enjoined Salah (prayer) upon me <br />
and to give Zakah (charity) as long as I live. <br />
And He has made me kind to my mother, <br />
and has not made me arrogant nor rebellious. <br />
And may God's peace be upon me the day I was born, <br />
the day I die and the day I will be raised up alive.&quot; <br />
That was Jesus, son of Mary, <br />
it was a statement of Truth, <br />
about which people will continue to dispute. <br />
It is not befitting for God to take a son. <br />
Glory be to Him, <br />
When He decrees a thing, He but says to it 'Be' <br />
and it is. <br />
Verily God is my Lord and your Lord, <br />
so worship Him and Him alone, <br />
as this is the straight path.&quot;19:16-36 <br />
2- His Message <br />
&quot;We (God) gave Moses the Book, <br />
and after him We sent a succession of Messengers. <br />
And We gave Jesus, son of Mary, <br />
clear signs and supported him <br />
with the Holy Spirit. <br />
Yet every time a Messenger comes to you <br />
with what you do not fancy, <br />
you become arrogant; <br />
some of them you reject <br />
and some of them you kill.&quot;2:87 <br />
&quot;These are God's verses <br />
which We (God) recited to you (O Muhammed), <br />
as the Truth, <br />
and indeed you are one of the Messengers. <br />
Those Messengers, We endowed them with bounty, <br />
and raised some in rank. <br />
Some spoke to God, <br />
and some were raised to higher degrees (of honour), <br />
and We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear signs, <br />
and supported him with the Holy Spirit. <br />
Had God willed, succeeding followers of these Messengers, <br />
would not have fought one another, <br />
after the clear signs that had come to them. <br />
But they chose to differ; <br />
Some believed and some disbelieved. <br />
Had God willed, they would not have <br />
fought one another, <br />
but God does what He wants.&quot;2:252-253 <br />
3- His Miracles <br />
&quot;God said, &quot;O Jesus, son of Mary, <br />
recount My blessings upon you, <br />
and upon your mother; <br />
when I assisted you with the Holy Spirit. <br />
You spoke to people from the cradle, <br />
and when you were of old age. <br />
And I taught you the Book, Wisdom, <br />
the Torah, and the Injeel. <br />
And you created out of clay, a figure of a bird, <br />
by My permission. <br />
and you breathed into it, and it was turned into a bird, <br />
by My permission. <br />
And you cured the blind and the leper, <br />
by My permission. <br />
And you brought forth the dead, <br />
by My permission. <br />
And I fended off the Children of Israel from you, <br />
when you brought them clear signs, <br />
while the unbelievers among them said <br />
&quot;this is but sheer magic!&quot; <br />
And when I inspired the disciples, <br />
&quot;Believe in Me and in My Messenger,&quot; <br />
they said, &quot;We believe . And You <br />
bear witness that we are <br />
among those who submit to God (Muslims). <br />
And when the disciples asked, <br />
&quot;O Jesus, son of Mary, <br />
Can your Lord send down to us, <br />
a table from heaven?&quot; <br />
He said, &quot;Fear God, if you are believers,&quot; <br />
They said &quot;We wish to eat from it, <br />
and to affirm our hearts in knowing <br />
that you told us the Truth, <br />
and that we ourselves would be its witnesses. <br />
And Jesus, son of Mary said, <br />
&quot;O God, our Lord, <br />
send us down from heaven a table, <br />
that would provide a festival <br />
for our first and last person, <br />
and would provide a miraculous sign from You. <br />
Provide for us, You are the best Provider.&quot; <br />
God said, &quot;Verily, I will send it down, <br />
unto you all. <br />
But, if any of you would disbelieve, <br />
after that, <br />
I will punish him with such a punishment, <br />
that I have not punished any other being.&quot;5:110-115 <br />
4- His Death <br />
&quot;And they said, &quot;We have killed the Messiah, <br />
Jesus, son of Mary, God's Messenger,&quot; <br />
But they neither killed him nor crucified him, <br />
even though it appeared so to them. <br />
And those who differ concerning him, <br />
surely are full of doubt; <br />
they have no firm knowledge of him, <br />
except by following conjecture, <br />
as they are not certain that they have killed him. <br />
Nay, God has raised him up to Him, <br />
God is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.&quot;4:157-158 <br />
5- His Nature <br />
&quot;Christ, son of Mary, <br />
was no more than a Messenger, <br />
like Messengers that passed away before him. <br />
His mother was a saint, <br />
but both had to eat food. <br />
Observe how We make clear to them Our signs, <br />
and observe how they turn away from the Truth. <br />
Say &quot;Would you worship, <br />
an inferior being other than God, <br />
with no power to harm or benefit you ?&quot; <br />
But God is All-Hearing, All-Knowing&quot;.5:75-76 <br />
&quot;Indeed, Jesus, in God's view is like Adam, <br />
He created him of dust, <br />
then He said unto him 'Be', <br />
and he was. <br />
The Truth comes from <br />
your Lord alone, <br />
do not be among the doubters.&quot;3:59-60 <br />
6- The Church Dogma <br />
&quot;Certainly they disbelieve (in the Truth) who say: <br />
&quot;God is the Messiah, son of Mary&quot;, <br />
For the Messiah said, <br />
&quot;O Children of Israel, <br />
worship God, my Lord and your Lord&quot;. <br />
Verily whoever takes an associate with God, <br />
God shall prohibit him from entering Paradise, <br />
and Hellfire will be his home; <br />
wrong-doers shall have no helpers.5:72 <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly they disbelieve (in the Truth) who say: <br />
&quot;God is the Third of Three,&quot; <br />
for no God is there but One God. <br />
If they do not refrain from what they say, <br />
painful torment will afflict those <br />
among them who disbelieve. <br />
Will they not turn to God and pray <br />
for His forgiveness ? <br />
God is All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate.&quot;5:73-74 <br />
&quot;Certainly they disbelieve (in the Truth) who say: <br />
&quot;God is the Messiah, son of Mary, <br />
Say &quot;who then shall over-rule God in any way, <br />
if He ever wants to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, <br />
and his mother and all those who are on earth ? <br />
To God belongs the Kingdom of Heavens and Earth, <br />
and all that is in between, <br />
He creates what He wills, <br />
God is capable of everything.&quot;5:17 <br />
&quot;They (who follow the Church Dogma) took the Messiah, <br />
son of Mary, as lord, apart from God, <br />
although they have been commanded <br />
to worship non other than the One God. <br />
There is no God but He, <br />
all glory be to Him, <br />
above whatever they take as an associate.&quot;9:31 <br />
&quot;Say: &quot;O people of the Book, do not go to extremes <br />
in your religion beyond the Truth. <br />
And do not follow the whims of those people <br />
who went astray before, and led many astray, <br />
and now again have gone astray <br />
from the truthful way.&quot;5:77 <br />
7- The Truth <br />
&quot;And when God said, &quot;O Jesus, son of Mary, <br />
have you told people, &quot;take me and my mother <br />
as two gods, apart from God?&quot; <br />
Jesus said, &quot;Glory be to You, <br />
never could I say what I have no right to say, <br />
Had I said it, you would indeed have known, <br />
You know what is within me, <br />
and I do not know what is within You, <br />
as You are the Knower of the Unseen. <br />
I only said to them what You have commanded me: <br />
&quot;Worship God, my Lord and your Lord&quot;. <br />
And I was a witness over them, <br />
while I was among them; <br />
but when You did take me up, <br />
You were Yourself the Watcher over them, <br />
You are a Witness over everything. <br />
If You punish them, they are Your servants, <br />
and if You forgive them, <br />
You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. <br />
And God said, &quot;this is the day on which <br />
the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness, <br />
with gardens that have rivers flowing beneath, <br />
dwelling in them forever, <br />
as God was well pleased with them, <br />
and they were well pleased with Him; <br />
indeed this is a supreme achievement. <br />
To God alone belongs the Kingdom of the <br />
Heavens and Earth and all that is in them, <br />
He is capable of everything.&quot;5:116-120 <br />
&quot;O Mankind, <br />
Verily, the Messenger (Muhammed) has brought you <br />
The Truth from your Lord, <br />
Therefore, believe (in God, in His Messenger and in <br />
the Truth) for your own good, <br />
but if you disbelieve, <br />
(You will not harm God's Kingdom), <br />
As to God belongs all that is in <br />
the Heavens and Earth, <br />
God is All-Knowing, All-Wise. <br />
O People of the Book (Christians), <br />
Do not make up exaggerations in your faith and <br />
say nothing about God except the Truth. <br />
Christ; Jesus the son of Mary, <br />
is only God's Messenger, <br />
(who has been created by God through) His Word <br />
(Be) given to Mary and <br />
a spirit (which was given) by Him. <br />
Therefore, believe in God and all His Messengers. <br />
Do not speak of (and believe in) the trinity and <br />
refrain (from speaking of and believing in the <br />
trinity), for your own good. God is the only one God, <br />
All Glory be to Him, (far Exalted is He) above <br />
having a son, <br />
as to Him belongs all that is in the Heavens, <br />
and all that is in and on Earth. <br />
Sufficient is God as the only guardian, <br />
(looking after the affairs of the whole Universe; <br />
He does not need a son). <br />
Never did Christ feel too proud to be <br />
God's worshipper and servant, <br />
nor do the angels who are near (God). <br />
Whoever feels too proud and arrogant to worship <br />
and serve Him (should know that), <br />
He will summon them all <br />
(on the Day of Judgement); <br />
As for those who believed and <br />
did good deeds, God will grant them <br />
their just and full rewards and <br />
will give them yet more out of His bounty, <br />
Whereas those who felt too proud <br />
to worship God, <br />
He will punish them with <br />
a painful torment and <br />
they will find none other than God to protect <br />
and help them.&quot;4:170-173 <br />
&quot;Say: He is God, the One God, <br />
the Eternal, the Absolute, <br />
He has not begotten, <br />
and has not been begotten, <br />
and none is equal to Him.&quot;112:1-4 <br />
&quot;And We never sent a Messenger before you <br />
without revealing to him: <br />
'There is no deity but I, <br />
therefore serve and worship Me.' <br />
But they say: 'The All-Merciful has taken a son,' <br />
Glory be to Him, <br />
they are but honoured servants, <br />
they speak not before He speaks, <br />
and they act as He commands.&quot;21:25-27 <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoever invokes any other diety <br />
with God, without having proof, <br />
his accountability is with his Lord, <br />
Surely the disbelievers shall not prosper.&quot;23:117 <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;To Him (God) belongs the Kingdom <br />
of the Heavens and the Earth, <br />
no son has He begotten, <br />
nor has He a partner in His Kingdom, <br />
it is He who created everything, <br />
and ordained them perfectly. <br />
Yet they have taken, apart from Him, gods <br />
that create nothing and themselves are created, <br />
and have no power to hurt or profit themselves, <br />
nor have they power over death, <br />
nor life, nor resurrection.&quot;25:2-3 <br />
&quot;Dispute not (O Muslims) with the People of the Book, <br />
Save in the fairer manner, <br />
except those of them that do wrong. <br />
And say &quot;we believe in the revelation <br />
which has been sent down to us, <br />
and that which has been sent down to you, <br />
our God and your God are ONE, <br />
to Him we have surrendered in Islam&quot;.&quot;29:46 <br />
