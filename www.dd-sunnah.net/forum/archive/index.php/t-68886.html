As the Hijri year draws to a close, there are many text messages saying that the page recording oneís good deeds will be closed at the end of the year, and urging us to end it with prayers for forgiveness and fasting. What is the ruling on these messages? Is fasting the last day of the year Sunnah? If it coincides with a Monday or a Thursday is that bidíah?. x<br />
<br />
Answer: x<br />
Praise be to Allaah. x<br />
<br />
The Sunnah indicates that peopleís good deeds are taken up to be shown to Allaah without any delay, twice each day: once at night and once during the day. <br />
<br />
In Saheeh Muslim (179) it is narrated that Abu Moosa al-Ashíari (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood up before us and told us five things. He said: ìAllaah, may He be glorified and exalted, does not sleep and it is not befitting that He should sleep. He lowers the Balance and raises it; the deeds of the night are taken up to Him before the deeds of the day, and the deeds of the day before the deeds of the nightÖî Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The recording angels go up with the deeds of the night after it ends, at the beginning of the day, and they go up with the deeds of the day after it ends, at the beginning of the night. <br />
<br />
Al-Bukhaari (555) and Muslim (632) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ìThe angels of the night and the day come to you in succession, and they meet at Fajr prayer and at ëAsr prayer, then those who stayed among you ascend and their Lord asks them, although He knows best about them, ëHow did you leave My slaves?í and they say, ëWe left them when they were praying and we came to them when they were praying.íî  <br />
<br />
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: This indicates that deeds are taken up at the end of the day. Whoever is in a state of obedience at that time will be blessed in his provision and his work, and Allaah knows best. Hence we can see the wisdom behind the command to perform these prayers (Fajr and ëAsr) regularly and pay attention to them. End quote. <br />
<br />
The Sunnah indicates that deeds are also shown to Allaah (may He be glorified and exalted) twice each week. <br />
<br />
Muslim (2565) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ìPeopleís deeds are shown [to Allaah] twice each week, on Monday and Thursday, and every believing slave is forgiven except a person between whom and his brother there is a dispute, and it is said, ëLeave these two until they reconcile.íî <br />
<br />
The Sunnah also indicates that the good deeds of each year are taken up to Allaah all at once in the month of Shaíbaan. <br />
<br />
Al-Nasaaíi (1257) narrated that Usaamah ibn Zayd (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I said: O Messenger of Allaah, I do not see you fasting as much in any month as you fast in Ramadaan. He said: ìThat is a month concerning which the people are heedless, between Rajab and Ramadaan, but it is a month in which good deeds are taken up to the Lord of the Worlds, and I would like my deeds to be taken up when I am fasting.î Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaamií. <br />
<br />
These texts may be summed up by noting that peopleís deeds are shown to Allaah in three ways:<br />
<br />
∑        Daily, which happens twice a day<br />
<br />
∑        Weekly, which also happens twice, on Mondays and Thursdays<br />
<br />
∑        Annually, which happens once, during the month of Shaíbaan <br />
<br />
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The deeds of the year are taken up in Shaíbaan, as the truthful one (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) has told us. The deeds of the week are shown on Monday and Thursday, the deeds of the day are taken up at the end of the day before night comes, and the deeds of the night are taken up at the end of the night, before day comes. When a personís life comes to an end, all his lifeís deeds are taken up and the record of his deeds is closed. End quote from Haashiyat Sunan Abi Dawood. <br />
<br />
The ahaadeeth which indicate that deeds are shown to Allaah indicate that it is encouraged to do more deeds of obedience at the times when the deeds are being shown to Him, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said concerning fasting in Shaíbaan: ìI would like my deeds to be taken up when I am fasting.î <br />
<br />
In Sunan al-Tirmidhi (747) it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ìDeeds are shown (to Allaah) on Mondays and Thursdays, and I would like my deeds to be shown when I am fasting.î Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwaí al-Ghaleel (949) <br />
<br />
One of the Taabiíeen used to weep in front of his wife on Thursdays and she would weep in front of him, and he would say: Today our deeds are being shown to Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. (This was mentioned by Ibn Rajab in Lataaíif al-Maíaazif) <br />
<br />
From what we have mentioned it is clear that there is no suggestion that at the end of an old year or the beginning of a new year the records of deeds are closed and deeds are shown to Allaah. Rather deeds are shown to Him in the various ways that we have mentioned, and the texts describe other times for this. The texts also indicate that the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is to do more acts of obedience at those times. <br />
<br />
Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve him) said concerning commemorating the end of the year: ìThere is no basis for that, and singling out the end of the year for specific acts of worship such as fasting is a reprehensible innovation (bidíah).î End quote. <br />
<br />
With regard to fasting on Mondays and Thursdays, if that is a personís habit, or if he is fasting on those days because of the reports which encourage doing so, then he should not refrain from doing so because it coincides with the end or beginning of the year, so long as he is not fasting on that day because of that coincidence, or because he thinks that there is any special virtue in fasting on that occasion. <br />
<br />
And Allaah knows best.<br />
