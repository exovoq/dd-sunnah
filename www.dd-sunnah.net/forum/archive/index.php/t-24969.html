<br />
This is one of a series of posts from the great book of Awasim min Al-Qawasim (Defence against disaster) by Abu Bakr Ibn Al-Arabi (written 536 Hijra). The extracts are from the translation of &quot;SHAYKH `ABDALQADIR AL-MURABIT&quot;<br />
<br />
DISASTER<br />
Following the transmission of liars, many stated that `Uthman committed some injustices and objectionable things while he was ruler. They included:<br />
1) He beat `Ammar until his intestines split open.<br />
2) He beat ibn Mas`ud until his ribs were broken. He denied him his gift.<br />
3) He innovated by collecting the Qur'an and in compiling and burning the copies of the Qur'an.<br />
4)  He set up the Hima (sanctuary for animals).<br />
5) He drove Abu Dharr out to Ar-Rabadha.<br />
6) He expelled Abu'd-Darda' from Syria.<br />
7) He brought back al-Hakam after the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had exiled him.<br />
8) He voided the sunna of shortening the travel-prayer.<br />
9-12) He appointed Mu`awiya,....(1)(`Abdullha b. `Amir b. Kurayz)  and Marwan. He appointed al-Walid b. `Uqba who was a deviant and not one of the people of rule.<br />
13) Giving Marwan the khums  (fifth) of North Africa.<br />
14) `Umar used to beat with the darra (2) (stick) and he beat with the staff. <br />
15) He went above the step of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when Abu Bakr and `Umar went below it.<br />
16) He did not attend Badr and was defeated on the day of Uhud. He was not at the Covenant of Ridwan (at Hudaybiya).<br />
17) He did not kill `Ubaydullah b. `Umar for al-Hurumzan who had given the knife to Abu Lu`Lu`a and encouraged him againt `Umar until he killed him.)<br />
18) He sent a letter with the slave of his camels to Ibn Abi Sarh, to kill those who were mentioned in it.<br />
<br />
PROTECTION <br />
All of this is false in isnad and text. As for their words: `&quot;Uthman did injustices and objectionable things&quot;, that is false(3). <br />
<br />
1-2) (3)As for his beating Ibn Mas`ud and denying him his gift, that is a lie.  That he beat `Ammar is also a lie. If his intestines had broken open, he would never have lived. (4)  The `ulama excuse that because of aspects with which one should not be occupied because they are based on something false.  A truth is not based on something false. (5) Do not spend time in keeping up with the ignorant. That has no end. <br />
<br />
3) As for gathering the Qur'an, that was his greatest good work and the greatest virtue, even if he had found it already completed. However, he made it known and returned people to it  and cut off the business of dispute about it. The promise of Allah was carried out to preserve the Qur'an at his hands as we have made clear in books on the Qur'an and elsewhere.(6)  All the Imams (7) related that Zayd b. Thabit said, &quot;Abu Bakr sent to me about the murderous fight with the people of Yamama.(8)  While `Umar b. al-Khattab was with him, Abu Bakr said, `&quot;Umar has come to us and said, `Fighting was intense on the day of Yamana, and many of the reciters were killed. I fear that if many more reciters are killed in other places, then much of the Qur'an will be lost. I think that the Qur'an should be gathered together.' I said to `Umar. `How can we do something which the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not do?' `Umar said, `This is good, by Allah.' He continued to argue with me until Allah opened by breast to it and I thought the same as `Umar thought about it.'&quot; Zayd said,&quot; Abu Bakr said, `You are a young man of intellect and we do not suspect you. You used to write down the revelation of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, so look for the Qur'an and assemble it.' By Allah, if they had asked me to move a mountain, that would not have been heavier on me than what they commanded me to do in assembling the Qur'an. I said, `How can you do something which the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did not do?&quot; `Umar said, `By Allah, this is good.' He continued to argue with me until Allah expanded my breast to that which he expanded the breast of Abu Bakr and `Umar. I sought after the Qur'an in order to assemble it from palm branches, thin stones and the hearts of men.(9)  The pages remained with Abu Bakr until Allah made him die. Then they were with `Umar during his lifetime. Then they were with Hafsa bint `Umar  until Hudhayfa b. al-Yaman came to `Uthman. (10) He had raided with the people of Syria in the conquest of Armenia and in Azerbayjan with the people of Iraq. Hudhayfa told him about their disagreement about the recitation. Hudhayfa said to `Uthman, &quot;Amir al-Mu`minin, save this community before they disagree about the Book as the jews and christians disagree!&quot; So `Uthman sent a messenger to Hafsa, &quot;Send us the pages of the Qur'an and we will make copies from them. Then we will return  them.&quot; Hafsa sent them to `Uthman. Then he commanded Zayd b. Thabit., Abdullah b. Az-Zubayr, Sa`id b. Al-`As, and `Abdu'r- Rahman b. Al-Harith b. Hisham and they copied out copies of the Qur'an. (11)  `Uthman said to the group of the three Qurayshis, &quot;When you and Zayd b. Thabit disagree about some part of the Qur'an, write it in the tongue of Quraysh. It was sent down in their tongue.&quot; So they did that.<br />
<br />
When they had copied the pages and made copies of the Qur'an, `Uthman returned the pages to Hafsa and sent a copy of their copy to every area and commanded that every page and copy of any other Qur'an should be burned. <br />
<br />
Ibn Shihab said (12)  &quot;Kharija b. Zayd informed me that he heard Zayd b. Thabit say, &quot;One  ayat of the sura of `The Clans (al-Ahzab) was missing when he copied out the mushaf which I had heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah  bless him and grant him peace, recite. We looked for it and found it with Khuzayma al-Ansari, `There are men from the believers who are true to the contract which Allah took from them.' We attached it to its sura in the copy of the Qur'an.&quot;<br />
<br />
As for what is related that he burned them or ripped them (with Ha' or Kha') both are possible since there  would have been corruption  in letting them remain, or that there was something in them that was not part of the Qur'an or something abrogated from it, or it was not in the proper order. All the Companions  submitted to that , although it is related that Ibn Mas`ud spoke in Kufa and said, &quot;Allah said, `Whoever, defrauds will bring what he has defrauded on the day of rising.' I take away your copies of the Qur'an. Whoever of you is able to take away his copy of the Qur'an should do it.&quot; Ibn Mas`ud meant that his mushaf would be taken from him and he should confirm what he knew in it. When that was not done for him, he said what he said. Therefore `Uthman forced him to remove his copy of the Qur'an and erase its marks so Ibn Mas`ud never had a firm recitation. Allah helped `Uthman and the truth by removing it from the earth (i.e. Ibn Mas`ud's version).(14) <br />
<br />
================================================== ======<br />
<br />
  1. The name of Ibn Kurayz is dropped from the root by the forgetfulness of copyist or reader in the Algerian publication while he is mentioned in the following defence. It is clear to us that the volumes of the written source on which the Algerian edition was published, was written with some pages not in their proper places in the binding. We adjusted the order of their questions and their answers properly. We did not add any words to the root and we did not take any words from it. By that, we put the confusion  right which is clear to the reader in the Algerian edition.<br />
<br />
  2. The darra is a small stick which the Sultan carries for curbing people.<br />
<br />
  3. As you wil see from the proofs which the author will bring, to discredit these questions of theirs, one by one, until we come to the last of them.<br />
<br />
  4. It was already stated in the margin, p. 49, when `Uthman was given the allegiance, `Abdullah b. Mas`ud said, &quot;We have appointed the highest of us and we did not neglect anyone.&quot; When `Uthman was appointed, Ibn Mas`ud was the governor of `Umar over the people of Kufa and Sa`d b. Abi Waqqas was in charge of the prayer and was there. Sa`d and Ibn Mas`ud disagreed about a loan when Sa`d asked him for a loan - as will come. Therefore `Uthman dismissed Sa`d and kept Ibn Mas`ud. Up to this point, the relationship between Ibn Mas`ud and his Khalif was untroubled. When `Uthman determined to make one copy of the Qur'an universal in the Islamic world, the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, agree that it would be the complete copy which agreed with the last form of presentation  in which the Book of Allah, the Mighty, the Exalted, was presented to His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, before his death.  Ibn Mas`ud wanted the writing of the mushaf to be entrusted  to him. He also wanted his copy of the Qur'an which he had written for himself in the past to remain. (`Uthman acted  contrary to what Ibn Mas`ud wanted in both cases.) `Uthman chose Zayd b. Thabit to write the single mushaf because Abu Bakr and `Umar had chosen him before that for this task during the khalifate of Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr and `Umar chose Zayd b. Thabit in the beginning because he was the one who preserved the final form in which the Book of Allah was presented to the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, before his death. `Uthman was right in this. He knew, as all the Companions knew, the place of Ibn Mas`ud and his knowledge and he confirmed his belief. Then `Uthman was also right in purging all the other copies, including the copy of Ibn Mas`ud, because making the ************************ of the mushaf the one with the most perfect from possible is by the consensus of the Companions the greatest of the things which `Uthman did. Most of the Companions were with `Uthman in that against Ibn Mas`ud. (Look at `The Path of the Sunna' by Ibn Taymiyya, 3:19, 1-192). In any case, `Uthman did not beat Ibn Mas`ud and did not deny him his gift. He continued to recognise his worth as Ibn Mas`ud continued to obey him as his imam to whom he had given homage and he believed that he was the best of the muslims at the moment of the homage. <br />
<br />
  5. At-Tabari related (5:99) from Sa`id b. al-Musayyib that there was a disagreement between `Ammar and `Abbas b. `Utba b. Abi Lahab which moved `Uthman to discipline them by beating them. I said: This is a part of what the one in command does in cases like these both before and after `Uthman. How frequently `Umar did that to the likes of `Ammar and to those  who were better than `Ammar  his right  of rule  over the muslims. When the Saba`ites organised the dissemination of rumours and began to send letters from every city to other cities with false reports, the Companions indicated to `Uthman that he should send men in whom he had confidence to the cities so that they could return and tell him the true state of affairs. `Uthman forgot what had come from `Ammar and sent him to Egypt with his full confidence to investigate the state of affairs there. `Ammar delayed a while in Egypt and the Saba'ites gathered to him to try to make him take their side. `Uthman and his governor in Egypt took steps to remedy this and `Ammar was brought back to Madina by force. `Uthman censured  him for what he had dared to do. According to what Ibn `Asakir related in the History of Damascus (7:429), he said to him, &quot;Abu'l-Yaqadhan! You slandered Ibn Abi Lahab when he slandered you, then you were angry with me because I took what was due from you and what was due from him. Oh Allah, I have been given the injustice between me and my community. Oh Allah, I draw near to You by establishing Your hudud on everyone and I do not care. Leave me, `Ammar..&quot; He left. When `Ammar met the common people, he defended himself and denied that. When he met someone he trusted, he admitted what he had done and showed regret. People censured him, parted from him, and disliked him.<br />
Ibn Taymiyya said is `The Path of the Sunna' (3:192-192), `&quot;Uthman was better  than all who spoke against him. He was better than Ibn Mas`ud, `Ammar, Abu Dharr and others in many aspects, as in confirmed by proofs. The words of one who is surpassed do  not detract from one who is better, let alone the opposite. That is how what `Ammar said against `Uthman is tranmitted as well as what al-Hasan said about `Ammar. It is transmitted that `Ammar said `&quot;Uthman has rejected with the notorious unbelievers.&quot; Al-Hasan b. `Ali objected  to him saying that. It was the same with `Ali who said to him `&quot;Ammar, do you reject a Lord in whom `Uthman believes?&quot; Ibn Taymiyya said, &quot;It is clear from that that a believing man who is a wali of Allah, can believe that another believing man who is also a wali of Allah is an unbeliever, and he can  be wrong in this opinion. That does not detract from the belief and wilaya of either of them.&quot; It is confirmed in the `Sahih' that `Usayd b. Hudayr said to Sa`d b. `Ubada in the presence of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, &quot;You are a hypocrite who argues for the hypocrites&quot; and as `Umar b. al-Khattab said to Hatib b. Abi Balta`a, &quot;Messenger of Allah, let me cut the neck of this hypocrite!&quot; He, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, &quot;He was at Badr. How do yo know? Perhaps Allah has looked with pity on the people of Badr and said, `Act as you like. I have forgiven you.&quot;' `Umar was better than `Ammar and `Uthman was better than Hatib b. Abi Balta`a by many degrees. `Umar's proof in what he said to Hatib was more apparent than `Ammar's. In spite of this, both of them are people of the Garden. How can `Uthman and `Ammar not be people of the Garden, even if one of them said what he said to the other? However, a group of the `ulama' deny that `Ammar said that. The Shaykh al-Islam said, &quot;In general, when it is said that `Uthman beat Ibn Mas`ud or `Ammar, this does not detract from any of them. We testify that the three are in the Garden and that they are among the great fearful awliya of Allah. A wali of Allah can do something that merits the punishment of the Shari`a, not to mention discipline. `Umar b. al-Khattab beat Ubayy b. Ka`b with the stick when  he saw people walking behind them. He said, &quot;This is abasement to the follower  and temptation for the followed.&quot; If `Uthman disciplined those, either `Uthman was correct in doing it since they deserved that and they repented of that for which they were punished and made amends by discipline and other afflictions or it is by their immense good actions or other things, or it is said that they were completely wronged. The statement about `Uthman is like the statement about them and more so. He was better than them and more entitled to forgiveness and mercy.<br />
<br />
  6. i.e. on the claims of the liars, the enemies of the Companions of the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is that the Amir al-Mu`minun `Uthman beat `Ammar until his intestines split open and that he beat Ibn Mas`ud until his ribs were broken and denied him his gift. <br />
<br />
<br />
 7. i.e. The books of Ibn al-`Arabi connected to the sciences of the Qur'an. We mentioned in his biography (pp.27-28) that they included `The Lights of Dawn' (in 70 or 80 volumes), `The Law of Interpretation' which is among his great works, `The Judgements of the Qur'an' published in Egypt and `The Book of the Obscure' and `The Abrogating and the Abrogated'.<br />
<br />
  8. In the Preface of Imam Ahmad in his `Musnad' (1:13, first edition, no.76, second edition and 5:188-189, first edition), Imam al-Bukhari from his `Sahih' in `The Book of Tafsir' (book 65, sura 9, chap. 20, pt. 5, pp.210-211), `The Book of the Virtues of the Qur'an' (book 66, chap. 3 &amp; 4, pt. 6, pp. 98-99), `The Book of the Judgements' (book 93, chap. 37, pt. 8, pp. 118- 119) and `The Book of Tawhid' (book 97, chap. 22, pt. 8, pp. 176- 177).<br />
<br />
 9. That was when the Banu Hanifa apostatized under the leadership of Musaylima the Liar and by the encouragement of the enemy of Allah, Ar-Rajjal b. `Anfawa b. Nahshal  al-Hanafi. The generalship of the muslims belonged to the sword of Allah, Khalid b. al-Walid, and Zayd b. al-Khattab, the brother of `Umar, was martyred in this bloody fight. The huffaz of the Qur'an among the Companions consulted among themselves and said, &quot;Oh people of the sura of the Cow, the dawn today is false.&quot; The Khatib of the Ansar and the bearer of their banner, Thabit b. Qays shrouded himself and dug his feet into the ground up to the middle of his legs. He continued to fight remaining firm in his place with the banner until he was marytered. The Muhajirun said to Salim, the client of Abu Hudhayfa, &quot;Do you fear we will come before you?&quot; He answered, &quot;Then I would be an evil bearer of the Qur'an.&quot; He fought until he was martyred. Abu Hudhayfa said, &quot;They have edorned the Qur'an by action&quot;. He continued to fight until he was struck down. One of those martyred on that day was Huzn b. Abi Wahb, al-Makhzumi, the grandfather of Sa`id b. al-Musaayyib. The battlecry of the Companions of that day was, &quot;Muhammad!&quot; They were steadfast on that day with a patience which has never been matched, until the apostates sought refuge in Hadiqatu'l-Mawt and Musaylima and his men sought shelter in it. Al-Bara' b. Malik said, &quot;Oh company of muslims! Throw me inside the garden and I will open its doors to you.&quot; They carried him over the ditches and raised him with spears and threw him into the garden over the walls. He contined to fight the apostates by its door until he opened it and the muslims entered and there was victory. Among those who plunged into the garden was Abu Dujana, one of the fighters of Badr, and when he reached Musaylima, he got above him with his sword and killed him. He broke his foot in that battle, may Allah be pleased with him, and then obtained martyrdom. `The Beginning and the End' (6:334-340) has the names of many of the martyrs of this terrible day in Islam. They included those who knew the Qur'an by heart.<br />
<br />
 10. `Usub, the plural of `Asib is a palm branch without leaves, they are the parts on which the leaves do not grow. Likhaf (the plural of Lukhfa) are fine white stones. They used to write on both of them when paper was scarce. <br />
until I found the end of  the sura at-Tawba with Khuzayma Al- Ansari which I did not find with anyone else: `A messenger of Allah has come from among you...' until the end of the sura.&quot;<br />
<br />
  11. His hadith from that is in the `Sahih' of al-Bukhari (book 66, chap. 3, pt. 6, p. 99) from Ibn Shihab az-Zuhri from  Anas b. Malik. <br />
<br />
  12. The two great  men of Islam, Abu Bakr and `Umar were concerned about it. Their brother and in-law Dhu`n-Nurayn `Uthman completed it  by gathering the Qur'an and making it firm and making its text one. Through that , they gave the greatest blessing to the muslims. By it, Allah fulfilled His promise when He said, &quot;We sent down the remembrance and We preserved it.&quot; After these three shaykhs, the khalifate was given to the Amir al- Mu`minin `Ali and he carried on their work and confirmed the mushaf of `Uthman both in its start and recitation in all of the cities under his rule. There is a consensus from the first muslims that what Abu Bakr, `Umar and `Uthman established was their greatest good deed. One of the `ulama' of the Shi`a relayed this consensus from the tongue of the Amir al-Mu`minin `Ali b. Abi Talib. It has come in the book of the History of the Qur'an by Abu `Abdullah az-Zanjani (p. 46) that `Ali b. Musa, known as Ibn Ta`us (589-664), who is one of their `ulama', transmitted in his book, `The Happiness of the Happy', that Ash-Shahrastani said in the preface of his tafsir from Suwayd b. `Alqama, &quot;I heard `Ali b. Abi Talib, peace  be upon him, say, 'Oh people! Allah!Allah! Beware  of excess in the affair of `Uthman and your statement regarding burning the copies of the Qur'an. By Allah, he burned them with permission from the  assembly of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.' We agreed. He said, `What do you say about this recitation about which people disagree? One man meets another man and says, &quot;My recitation is better than your recitation?&quot; This leads to kufr.' We said, `What is your opinion then?' He said, `I want people to agree on one copy. If you disagree today, those after you will have to worse disagreement.' We said, `What you think is good.&quot;' Something there is no doubt about is that the aggressors themselves in the khalifate of `Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, used to recite the mushaf of `Uthman about which the Companions had agreed and `Ali was among them. But some followers in the succeeding generations  have disagraced themselves by their idiocy and their rejection like Shaytan at-Taq, Muhammad b. Ja`far ar-Rafidi according to what Imam Ibn Hazm related in `The Fisal' (4:181) from al-Jahiz. He said, &quot;Abu Ishaq Ibrahim an- Nizam and Bishr b. Khalid informed them that they said to Muhammad b. Ja`far ar-Rafidi, known as Shaytan at-Taq, `Woe to you! Aren't you shamed before Allah to say in your book on the Imamate: &quot;Allah ta'ala did not say at all in the Qur'an, &quot;The second of two when they were in the Case when he said to his companion, `Do not be sad, Allah is with us.&quot;&quot; They said, `By Allah, Shaytan at-Taq laughed a long time until it was as if we were the ones who had wronged him.&quot;' This Shaytan at-Taq was the greatest of the propagandists of the Shi`a for the two Imams, Zayd and his nephew Ja`far as-Sadiq. He is the one who originated  the lie that the Imamate is covenanted to certain individuals. No one had ever said that before this Shaytan at-Taq. Imam Zayd objected to him saying that in the assembly of Ja`far.<br />
The claim of the Rafidites is to change the Qur'an when `Ali clearly stated that the Companions agreed on what `Uthman had undertaken. Abundant material has gone to the Christian missionaries  who have used it as evidence. Ibn Hazm said to them in `The Fisal' (2:78), &quot;The Rafidites are not Muslims. They are a group who follow the course of the jews and the christians in lying and rejection.&quot; I said: The last of them who disgraced himself by this business and disgraced the Shi`a by it was Husayn b. Muhammad Taqi an-Nuri at -Tabarasi in his book about an assembly ascribed to the Amir al-Mu`minin, `Ali, which was published in an-Najaf in 1292 and published in Iran in 1298. I have a copy of it. Part of the nature of factionalism, partisanship  and bias is that it kills the intellects of people who ascribe to it and their character.<br />
<br />
  13. In what Imam al-Bukhari related from him in his `Sahih' (book 56, chap. 12, pt. 3, pp. 205-206, book 64, chap. 17, pt. 5, p. 31, sura 9, chap. 20 and sura 33, chap. 3, book 66, chaps. 3 &amp; 4, book 93, chap. 97 and book 87, chap. 22.)<br />
<br />
  14. `Abdullah b. Mas`ud was one of the great `ulama' of the Companions and one of those who were the most excellent in the recitation of the Book of Allah. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, once praised the good recitation  of the Qur'an of Ibn Mas`ud. Abu Bakr and `Umar raced to convey the good news of this prophetic praise (Look at `The Musnad' of Ahmad 1:25-26, first edition, no. 175, second edition). Ibn Mas`ud used to  write down what was revealed in the Qur'an in his copy whenever the revelation of ayats of it reached him. He differs in order of these ayats from the `Uthman copies which were based on the last presentation to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, according to the ijtihad of the Companions entrusted with gathering it. It is possible that in his copy, Ibn Mas`ud missed some of the ayats from other reciters of the Qur'an which Zayd b. Thabit and his collegues had searched out. In addition to that, Ibn Mas'ud was dominated  by the dialect of his people, Hudhayl. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, allowed people like Ibn Mas`ud recite in their own dialects, but it was not for Ibn Mas`ud to compel the community in his time and times after him to use his particular dialect. Part of the blessing was to unify the community in the recitation of the Book of its Lord in the Mudhari dialect which the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, spoke.</div></div><hr />
