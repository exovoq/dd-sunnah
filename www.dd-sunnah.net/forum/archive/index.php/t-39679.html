Thank you for your initiative.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, I don't know what Amushaf means. but generally the compilation of the Holy Quran was during Cliphate Uthmman (Radi allah Anhu) time.<br />
<br />
I don't know if I have the right to post a new question or not, any way I will do either I have the right or not, if I don't have; the one after me can give the answers for all of them. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Which University was the most active in distributing Knowledge for the past 40 or 50 years, giving scholarships for muslims around the world, many most knowledgeable scholars from many countries were graduated from its scholarship programmes, like Abdulhy yousef (Sudan), Omar Alashqar (Kuwait), and soo many others.</div></div><hr />

Welcome brother Purity of Islam<br />
<br />
Suhuf &amp; Mushaf are derived from the same root Sahafa 'to write'. The word suhuf also occurs in the Qur'an ì Surrat AlAlaí verse 19 ì [The Books of Ibrahim and Musa.],  meaning ************************ure or written sheets.<br />
<br />
Suhuf  ìsg. Sahifaî, means loose pieces of writing material, such as paper, skin, papyrus, etc.<br />
<br />
Mushaf (pl. masahif), means the collected suhuf, brought together into a fixed order, such as between two covers, into a volume.<br />
<br />
In the history of the written text of the Qur'an, suhuf stands for the sheets on which the Qur'an was collected in the time of Abu Bakr &quot; radi Allah anhu &quot;. In these suhuf the order of the ayat within each sura was fixed, but the sheets with the suras on them were still in a loose arrangement, i.e. not bound into a volume.<br />
<br />
Mushaf in the present context means the sheets on which the Qur'an was collected in the time of 'Uthman &quot; radi Allah anhu &quot;. Here both the order of the ayat within each sura as well as the order of the sheets were fixed.<br />
<br />
Today we also call any copy of the Qur'an, which has both order of ayat and suras fixed, a mushaf.<br />
<br />
So, your answer will be the compilation of Al-Quran to Amushaf was during Cliphate Uthmman &quot; radi Allah anhu &quot; time.<br />
<br />
your question idont have any idea but I think its AlAzhar University  :o is not it? <br />
<br />
Thanks 4 your posting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">purity of Islam</div><div class="date">29-03-05, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jazak allah kheer,<br />
<br />
I'm happy that my answer was right.<br />
<br />
but I'm not happy, that you've shown me an other right answer for my question, the answer I intended was IU Islamic university in Madinah, but your answer could be right without the graduated people Example in my question :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Any way, I'm happy for your participation. :( unfortunately you didn't post a new question, so I will not answer any thing. :) I will not ask also, you have to ask before.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way (I can speak arabic, I know what „’Õ› is, but I read it as „Ê‘«› which I couldn't recognize. That's right I used to use this word as you said. I really didn't have any idea about the meaning you've explained. Jazak allah kheer for this information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunniah forever</div><div class="date">29-03-05, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oooh Islamic University  :( how I forgot it :o, any way my answer was semi correct <br />
<br />
sorry brother i did not post anew question cuz am not sure if my answer was correct or not<br />
<br />
ok, my question about The Holy Quraan<br />
<br />
How many &quot;Ayat-us-Sajadahs&quot; are there in The Holy Quran?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">purity of Islam</div><div class="date">30-03-05, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">as I counted when I was young it was 14.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was sure, but I'm not sure any more. loooool<br />
<br />
<br />
I will ask you about the best Muhadeth (knowledgeable of hadeeth) in the late time, who had lived in Syria until eighties and then he transfered to Jordan and dead there, and origianally came from Albania.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunniah forever</div><div class="date">30-03-05, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent.. :) x<br />
<br />
about your question, the answer is AlSheikh Muhammed Nasser Aldeen Al-Albani &quot; may Allah's Mercy be upon him &quot;<br />
<br />
easy question.. :rolleyes: x<br />
<br />
i'll ask u about seerah..<br />
<br />
Who was the Prophet's Companion chosen to be the first muadzin? &quot; prayer calling &quot;x<br />
<br />
am sad no one paticipate with us.. :( x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">purity of Islam</div><div class="date">05-04-05, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first Muadzin ??? always you have confused to arrange the letters looooooool :confused: . Why the letter D was added??? :mad:<br />
<br />
Any way I think the answer is Sidna bilal Bin Rabah Radi allah anhu.<br />
<br />
:p if not then he is abdullah ibn umm maktoom.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry I gave two answers to make sure that I've done right. The problem is if they are all wrong loooooool.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will post a question either I'm right or wrong.<br />
<br />
I will go back to knowledge. Since the time of Mohammed (peace be upon him) there were four guys known as knowlegeable in Islamic shari'ah, (Fuqaha'a), Alshaf'y, Ibn Malik, Ahmed Ibn Hanbal, And Abo Hanifah. One of them was the most inclusive in his knowledge, and he used to include most of their information, fatawa, &amp; opinions and was the most knowledgeble in Hadeeth. Which one was that?</div></div><hr />
