PUBLIC LASHING HELD at school <br />
Author: By Joe Avancena <br />
<br />
The Saudi Gazette <br />
<br />
AL-KHOBAR <br />
<br />
A WOMAN on Monday received a public lashing from police in front of staff and students at the International Philippine School for striking a schoolgirl last December with a high-heel shoe. <br />
<br />
The lashing of Lucia Evangelista, a Filipina, had originally been scheduled for Sunday but was postponed after the school principal refused to allow it to be conducted in front of young school students. <br />
<br />
But the British father of the girl Evangelista struck with the shoe insisted that the 10 lashes be delivered in public. Monday, police ********************istered the punishment to a kneeling Evangelista in the school courtyard, as students and teachers looked on. <br />
<br />
Evangelista was also handed down a five-day jail term, which she already served. <br />
<br />
Evangelista, a parent of IPSA, hit Zena Maria Thirlwall in the shoulder with a high-heeled shoe during an altercation between her and Zena s father, Zane Martin Thirlwall, last December 11, 2003. <br />
<br />
Evangelista s husband, Francisco, who was also at the scene, shouted invectives at Thirwall. <br />
<br />
After the incident, Thirlwall, a British national, went to the school principal to complain about the attack, then to the School Governing Board, and finally to the Ministry of Education. He also sought the assistance of the Philippine Embassy. All these channels failed to help me in our case. Then I filed a complaint against Evangelista with the Al-Khobar Police on February 10, 2004, Thirlwall said. <br />
<br />
While the case was in progress, the school removed my children Zena Maria and Giancarlo from the school adding further insult and injury to our family, Thirlwall said. <br />
<br />
Evangelista was found guilty by the Dammam Sharia court, which ordered the police to arrest her. She went into hiding for several months, but finally surrendered to the police last Wednesday. She was immediately taken to the Dammam Reformatory Prison where she served the five-day jail term. <br />
<br />
The lashing Monday was witnessed by IPSA parents and few students. Evangelista and the police arrived at the school at 1 P.M. She was covered in Abaya from head to foot. Present was Philippine labor attaché Delmer R. Cruz and school officials. <br />
<br />
The lashing was supposed to have taken placed Sunday, but was called off by the police when school officials refused to allow students to witness the lashing, which the Thirlwall family demanded. <br />
<br />
Evangelista, with both hands and legs shackled, was waving her arms to parents when she was being led by the police back to prison. <br />
<br />
The case has polarized the IPSA school community. During last Sunday s scheduled lashing, Zena Maria confronted labor attaché Cruz asking why he was helping Evangelista and not being fair. I am the victim, why are you not helping me, I am 14 years old, and I am also a Filipina. Cruz said he did not answer her because he (Cruz) was just there to see to it that the order of the court is implemented. <br />
<br />
My focus then was about the implementation of the court order, we have to uphold the law and obey the mandate of the court. If I answered her, it will just prolong the discussion because the case is already decided, Cruz told The Saudi Gazette. <br />
<br />
After this very unfortunate incident, I hope the parents will no longer quarrel, and just work together for the good of the school, said Najeer Oquendo, a Philippine Overseas Labor Office interpreter helping distressed Filipinos. IPSA parents made the same comment. <br />
<br />
After the lashing, Evangelista did not show sign of remorse. Addressing the Thirlwalls and the crowd, she said in Tagalog Masaya na kayo, diba? (You are now happy, aren t you?). <br />
<br />
Saudi Gazette tried to talk to Evangelista s husband, but failed. He hurriedly left the scene with the police to sign the release paper of his wife. Evangelista was released Monday afternoon. She and her husband will be leaving the Kingdom as soon as he gets his end-of service award from his company and is given the final exit.</div></div><hr />
