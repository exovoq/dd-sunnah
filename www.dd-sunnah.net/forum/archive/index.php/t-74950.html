Men's rights is a stream in the men's movement. It is closely related to the fathers' rights movement and began as a recognisable movement in the 1960s, largely as an outgrowth of men's divorce societies. (The earliest organization which has been documented is the United States Divorce Reform, founded in Sacramento, California, by Ruben Kidd and George Partis in 1960.) Its professed aim is to promote the health and well-being of all men and boys, as part of a general human rights, civil rights or equal rights agenda. It is frequently concerned with wellness, economic fairness and family law. There is no single unifying manifesto or organization which can claim to speak for the entire movement and the term is often used in various, even conflicting ways.<br />

The Fathers' rights movement is a stream in the men's movement primarily interested with family law and gender bias issues as it affects biological fathers. Historically related to the men's rights movement, its advocates see it as a necessary corollary to the women's rights and children's rights movements. It emerged in the 1970s as a loose social movement providing a network of interest groups, primarily in western countries, established to campaign for equal treatment by the courts in issues such as child custody after divorce, child support, and paternity determinations. It is also part of the broader Men's rights movement and is related to the Masculists, which is more analytical and theoretical in approach.<br />
<br />
The fathers' rights movement received international press coverage following the formation and high profile style activism of Fathers 4 Justice in the UK.<br />

 Parental Responsibility <br />
<br />
See General Registry Office official information on births, marriages and deaths.<br />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
An important change for unmarried couples in England and Wales (Nov 2003)<br />
Note: This does not apply to births registered before 1 December 2003.<br />
<br />
the right to be responsible for your child<br />
<br />
The law changed on 1 December 2003 to make it easier for unmarried fathers to get equal parental responsibility: all you have to do is for both parents to register the birth of your baby together.<br />
<br />
Parental responsibility for your child gives you important legal rights as well as responsibilities. Without it, you don't have any right to be involved in decisions such as where they live, their education, religion or medical treatment. With parental responsibility, you are treated in law as the child's parent, and you take equal responsibility for bringing them up.<br />
<br />
Unlike mothers and married fathers, if you are not married to your baby's mother you do not automatically have parental responsibility for them.<br />
<br />
Before this change, you could only gain parental responsibility by later marrying the child's mother, signing an official agreement with the mother or getting a court order. You can still get responsibility in these ways - you might want to think about this if you have other children. <br />
See also Amendments of The Children Act 1989<br />
<br />
Those in Northern Ireland were lucky enough to have this law come into force on 17th July 2001, however those in Scotland are unfortunately still waiting.<br />
