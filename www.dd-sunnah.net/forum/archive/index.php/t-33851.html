I hope every shea person or christian or even jews&gt;&gt;to consider the follwing &quot;verses&quot; carefuly<br />
<br />
An oracle concerning Arabia : You! Caravans of Dedanites who camp in the thickets of Arabia ! <br />
Bring water for the thirsty; You! Who live in Tema ! Bring food for the fugitives : they flee from the sword, from the drawn-sword, from the bent-bow and from the heat of battle. This is what the Lord says to me (Isaiah) : within one year ! as a servant bound by a contract would count it; all the pomp of Kedar will come to an end. The survivors of the bow-men, the warriors of Kedar will be few. The Lord; the God of Israel, has spoken.&quot;<br />
<br />
                                              (Isaiah 21 : 13 to 17)<br />
<br />
# An oracle concerning Arabia : In the Bible of King James Version, we read &quot;a BURDEN upon Arabia&quot;. This means that ALLAH will impose a divine-responsibility upon Arabia. And indeed ALLAH has imposed upon the Arabia the duty to deliver and to spread His Sacred-Message to mankind. This message is : ISLAM.<br />
<br />
# Tema : It was an old-name ñ before ISLAM ñ of the Holy City called now by &quot;Madinah&quot;. And after ISLAM, it has got this new title &quot;Madinah&quot;.<br />
<br />
# Bring food for the fugitives : It is referring to the migration of Muhammed (pbuh) accompanied with his followers, from the &quot;Holy-City-Mekkah&quot; to the &quot;Holy-City-Madinah&quot;. And indeed the people of the &quot;Holy-Madinah&quot; has Well-entertained Muhammed (pbuh), they have given him water and food, and have indeed provided him peace and protected him from the pagansís persecution.This was a very good help for him to strengthen his power and to spread well his Holy-Message : ISLAM.<br />
<br />
# they flee ..... of battle : Itís referring to the suffering which the &quot;Spirit of Truth&quot; Muhammed (pbuh) including his followers would feel, and which caused them to migrate from the &quot;Holy-Mekkah&quot; to the &quot;Holy-Madinah&quot;.<br />
<br />
# within one year ! ...; all the pomp of kedar will come to an end...,the warriors of kedar will be  few ... : It is referring EXACTLY to the period of time (Since the migaration had happened) during which Muhammed (pbuh) became able to get back victory over his enemies who most of them were leaders of Arabia coming from Kedarís descendants. And Indeed, the Muslims won the holy-battle (itís called : Battle of BADR). Hence, the leadership of Kedar came to its end as they had rejected the religion of their fathers &quot;Ishmael&quot; and &quot;Abraham&quot;, because they &quot;Pagans&quot; were worshipping idols in stead of the Real-God ALLAH. Without forgetting that Kedar is the 2nd son among the 12 sons of Ismael. Kedar had had a lot of descendants than his brothers (thatís why they were leaders among the Arabian-tribes). Thanks now to the victory of Muhammed (pbuh), Kedarís descendants had lost the leadership of Arabia, and this leadership shifted from Kedarís descendants to Nebaiothís descendants from whom Muhammed came. (Nebaioth is the brother of Kedar and the first son of Ishmael. Let you read Genesis 25 : 13 to 16). <br />
<br />
<br />
at the end what i would say?<br />
 it is very painful that &quot;rafidi&quot; would hide this text to any christian even if he wished to call  the christians to what he calls &quot;islam&quot;...</div></div><hr />
