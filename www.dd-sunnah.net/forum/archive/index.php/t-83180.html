 <br />
today we begin the first detailed post on proving that the shia make illegal intercourse ; legal. And rather they hold it to be from the greatest acts of worship !<br />
 <br />
The narrations they have in their main books -in this subject- are just ludicrous and clearly devilish.<br />
 <br />
As for proving that Mutíah is haraam , this is clear , and we will be sufficed with what has been written in the other Sunni sites [linked on our homepage] ; so for those who wish for that , they should refer there.<br />
 <br />
Here , we prove the fact that indeed these heretics have made the loaning of private parts permissible, and we prove that they have created lies and fell into heresy by even refering these nasty &amp; false narrations back to Allaah , and His Prophet (sallahAllaahu alayhi wasallam), the Companions, and the Imaams [who are free from them - even though they ascribe themselves to them].<br />
 <br />
These quotes are from the book ëMustadrak al-wasilahí , it says :<br />
 <br />
[this is the highlited text ]<br />
 <br />
From Saleem bin ëAqabah that his father said : ëI asked Imam al-baqir (may peace be on him) is there a reward for the one who does  mutíah.?í<br />
 <br />
The imaam said: ìYes, if it is practiced for seeking the pleasure of Allah and to oppose fulaan [someone - I dont know who they mean by this].<br />
 <br />
And as such he will not talk to her  [the woman] any word ; except that Allaah  records a virtue for him. And when he gets close to her [engages in the sexual act with the woman] ; Allah forgives for him his sins. And when he  takes a bath [after the act]; Allah forgives his sins equal to the amount of water which passed on his hair .î<br />
 <br />
I [The narrator] said : ìEqual to the amount of hair on their bodies?î<br />
 <br />
The imam replied: ìYes, according to the number of hairs [wet by the water]..î<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
[I]next quote : [the first underline]<br />
 <br />
he said : î Indeed Allaah The Most Mighty The Most Majestic , Has made impermissible for our shia ; all that which intoxicates from any drink ñ and substituted in its place -for them-  Mutíah.î<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
next quote : [the last underline]<br />
 <br />
from baqir who said : The Prophet (sallahAllaahu alayhi wasallam), said :<br />
 <br />
ìWhen I was being taken to Heaven during the Israa (ascension),  Jibreel met me and told me: ë0 Muhammad, Allah The Most Mighty The Most Majestic says: ëI have forgiven all [of the sins of] those women who practice mutíah.î<br />
 <br />
end of quotes.<br />
 <br />
O, You Muslim who fears Allaah, O you Muslim of sound intellect : contemplate on these narrations of theirs , and then you be the judge !!?<br />
 <br />

<br />
