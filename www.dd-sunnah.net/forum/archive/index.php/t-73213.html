 <br />
&quot;... used to say in his sleep, 'Bring me the book entitled 'Al-Ilal.  Bring me the book entitled such and such.  Bring me the book entitled such and such.  Bring me the book entitled 'Al-Jarh wat-Ta'deel.'  And one time he said while he was asleep and while he was moving his hand as someone writing would, 'Bring Sunan Abi Dawood and the problem will be solved.'&quot;<br />
 <br />
One time he said to me whilst he was asleep, 'Bring the first volume of the book Al-Targheeb and Tarheeb.'  So I bought it.  He then said to me, 'Open it,' and I did.  He said, 'Look at one, two, three ahadith.  These are approximately equal in length?'  So I said, 'No.  There is one amongst them which is long.' He said, 'Continue ...' - this is during sleep, he is talking whilst he is asleep.  I then said to him, 'This third hadith is long.'  So he asked, 'Who narrated it?'  I replied, 'So and so.'  Then he said, 'Enough.  Return the book.'&quot;<br />
 <br />
All of this was when he was asleep!&quot;<br />
