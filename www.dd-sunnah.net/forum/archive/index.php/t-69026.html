<br />
One of the highest aspirations of _today's_ Israeli government is to build the &quot;Third Temple&quot; (the third renovation of Solomon's temple which has been destroyed twice before in history), there is only one issue,  the House of prayer &quot;Masjid-ul-Aqsa&quot; now stands in the same exact location.<br />
<br />
First Temple in 960 BC, Solomon is believed to have erected it to house the Ark of the Covenant which his father, David, had brought to Jerusalem. The temple was burned to the ground by the Babylonians in 586 BC.<br />
<br />
The Second Temple was consecrated in 515 BC, rebuilt by Herod in 20 BC and destroyed by Titus in 70 AD. <br />
<br />
The Byzantine Christians used the area as a dump and it was in this state that a Muslim, Caliph Omar Ibn al-Khattab, found it. In 638 AD. he ordered the place cleaned and built a House of Prayers at the southern end of the sanctuary, the apparent Third Temple &quot; Masjid-ul-Aqsa&quot;.<br />
<br />
http://www.jews-for-allah.org/image/Masjid-ul-Aqsa-Temple-Mount.jpg<br />
Masjid-ul-Aqsa was completed by Amir Abd ul Malik in 647 AD.<br />
<br />
With these observations in mind, the question is , has another sect of Jews co-orchestrated the Job of building the Third Temple ? *Jews for Allah* . It is well documented that Israelis along side their ancestral brothers, the Arabs, participated in the construction of Masjid-ul-Aqsa.<br />
<br />
For example, Ka'ab al-Ahbar, a Yemenite Jew who converted to Islam was a co-engineer in the construction. [Al-Tabari, The History of al-Tabari, Vol XII]<br />
<br />
Furthermore, it would have been impossible to clean the area containing decades of Byzantine litter and build this Holy Temple in only 10 years (no electricity), without the cooperation and assistance of the thousands of Jews in Jerusalem.  <br />
<br />
 The inhabitants of Israel left the Temple of Solomon a pile of rubble and garbage for almost (Six Hundred Years, nearly 10 generations of Israelis) 70 AD -to-  647 AD, until it was finally beautifully restored by the unity of Jews and ancestral brothers of Jews, the Muslims.<br />
<br />
Muslims do not claim to worship a different God than the Jewish God, in fact, just the opposite, Muslims declare they worship the God of Abraham, hence the Masjid-ul-Aqsa is in fact the restoration of the Temple Mount by direct descendants of Prophet Abraham.<br />
<br />
What's more, during one of the Crusades, the Crusaders thought the Masjid-ul-Aqsa was Solomon's temple and put a cross on it! If they had known that it was a Muslim temple, they would have torn it down, but it still stands. <br />
<br />
Further proof that Muslims have rebuilt the Temple Mount is that there are no idols in the current place of worship, there are no pictures, the prayers are preformed the way Jews used to pray (http://www.convertstoislam.org/Jews-prayed-like-Muslims.html), and the prayers are made directly to the Creator of Abraham with no intercessors.<br />
<br />
The Jews do not have to mourn or drop another tear, the Modern Temple has also been rebuilt to include in************************ions to counter the Trinity of Christianity from our Holy Site:<br />
<br />
the New Temple Mount was an answer to and a denial of the attractions of Christianity and its ************************ures, providing the Faithful with arguments to be used against Christian theology. The in************************ions are seven hundred and thirty-four feet long in all, amongst the lengthiest in************************ions in the world. <br />
<br />
The in************************ions are as follows:<br />
<br />
Inner Face: South Wall. In the name of God the Merciful the Compassionate. There is no God but God alone; he has no co-partner. He is the Kingship and His the praise. He giveth life and He causeth to die, and He hath power over everything.<br />
<br />
South-East Wall. Verily God and His angels pronounce blessing upon the Prophet. O ye who have pronounced blessings upon Him and give Him the salutation of peace. O, People of the Book (i.e. the Jews and Christians, always referred to as such by the Muslims -Ed.) do not go beyond the bounds in your religion and do not say about Allah anything but the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, is a messenger of God and His word which he cast upon Mary, and a spirit from Him. So believe only in God and of his messenger, but do not say &quot;Three&quot; (Trinity) and it will be better for you. God is only one God. Far be it from His glory that he should have a son.<br />
<br />
North Wall. The Messiah will not deny to be in the service of God nor will the angels who stand in his presence. O God; pray upon Thy messenger &quot;the servant Jesus - (N-W Wall) the son of Mary and peace be upon him the day of his birth, the day of his death and the day of his being raised alive.&quot; That is Jesus, son of Mary - a statement concerning which YOU are in doubt. It is not for God to take for Himself any offspring, glory be to Him.<br />
<br />
West Wall. God bears witness that there is no God but Him, likewise the angels and the people possessed of knowledge (S-W WALL) - Upholding justice. There is no God but He, the Almighty and All wise. Verily, the religion in God's sight is Islam.<br />
<br />
Outer Face: West and North-West Walls. In the name of God the Merciful and Compassionate. There is no God but God alone. Praise be to God who hath not taken to himself offspring. To Him there has never been any person in the sovereignty. Mohammed is the messenger of God, may God pray upon Him and accept his intercession.<br />
<br />
Praise be God who has not taken unto himself a son and who has no partner in sovereignty nor has He any protector on account of weakness.<br />
<br />
Islam has a History of Restoring ancient Temples and preserving current Houses of Worship as taught in Islam:<br />
<br />
In the time of the caliph 'Umar, certain Muslims had usurped a piece of land belonging to a Jew, and had constructed a mosque on the site. Learning the news, the caliph ordered the demolition of the mosque and the restoration of the land to the Jews.<br />
<br />
There are currently thousands of Jews  (http://www.convertstoislam.org/iranianjews.html)and hundreds of Synagogues in Muslim countries, dating over a 1,000 years old and Preserved in tact to this day, including the dozens of Temples kept in tact in Israel for the past millennium and a half while Muslims were responsible for Israel, if they were in ruble as the Romans had left the Temple Mount, the Muslims would have restored them to houses of worship as was done to the Temple of Solomon.<br />
<br />
According to M S M Saifullah, Another Temple restored  (http://www.islamic-awareness.org/History/kaaba.html)in history is one built by Prophet Abraham, the Ka'bah:<br />
<br />
http://www.jews-for-allah.org/image/Mecca-Kabba.jpg<br />
<br />
These are just two of Temples we observe to be restored, we conclude that a further study needs to be set forth to discover other Temples of God brought back to life by the children of Abraham, Muslims.<br />
<br />
In Conclusion, attempts (http://www.jerusalemites.org/crime_islam_2.html) to destroy the Masjid ul Aqsa to (re~re-build another House of Worship is not an act of God, but rather an act of pride, egotism, and nationalism, and would severely polarize the nearly 1.5 Billion Muslims with the other children of Abraham. Rather than plotting against Masjid ul Aqsa, Jews need to be thankful to God for sending our ancestral brothers to restore the ancient Temples, which laid in ruins for centuries under Israeli control.</div></div><hr />
