Family  Life in Islam<br />
Author: Khurshid  Ahmad<br />
1974:edition<br />
Islam is a complete way. It has  a distinct outlook on  life. It aims at producing a unique personality in the  individual and a  distinct culture for the community based on Islamic ideals and  values.  The institutions of marriage and the family occupy a very important   position in this scheme of life. An effort is being made in this small  book to  explain the Islamic concept of marriage and the family. The  original inspiration  for this essay came from a recent conference. The  Standing Conference on  Christian-Muslim Dialogue organized a three day  conference at Wood Hall,  Wetherby, Yorks, on the family in Christianity  and Islam. I was invited to  present Islamic viewpoint on the subject.  The talk produced immense interest and  sparked off very useful  discussions in the following days. As the talk was given  before a  predominantly Christian audience I had to begin with the Islamic   approach to life and gradually explain the institution of the family and  the  principles on which the family relations are built in a Muslim  society. The  present book is an out-growth of that talk. I hope it  will, in its present form,  reach a much wider audience and will be  helpful in developing a better  understanding of the Islamic family.<br />
