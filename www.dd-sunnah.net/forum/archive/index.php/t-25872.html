All praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of all Being, the All-merciful, the All-compassionate, the Master of the Day of Judgment.[1] May Allahís mercy and peace be upon all of His Messengers and truthful and pure Prophets; and may His mercy and peace be upon the master of the children of Adam and the seal of the Prophets, our Prophet Muhammad, the trustworthy Messenger; and may His mercy and peace be upon Muhammadís family, companions and whoever follows his guidance till the Day of Judgment.<br />

For Whom Am I Writing this Essay?<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
My brothers and sisters everywhere! With this essay, I am not singling out the adherents of Islamóto which I ascribeóbut rather I am writing this essay to every man and woman throughout the whole world.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I ask Allah that He facilitates that this essay reaches every ear, falls under the sight of every eye, and is understood by every heart.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
By Allah, I have written this essay sincerely. I do not seek from anyone reward or praise. I only seek to convey to all my brethren in humanity, irrespective of their races or religions, an aspect of the great message that Muhammad the son of ëAbdullah, Allahís final messenger to all the peoples of the earth, was sent with.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Specifically, I have chosen to explain the wisdom behind those laws that Allah has legislated regarding women. As contingent upon these laws, an individualís bliss on earth is gained and his humanity is achieved. Moreover, these Islamic regulations pertaining to women have been singled out for attack by the enemies of humanity, who seek to follow their desires and who are short-sighted. Rather, they have put an end to a personís bliss on earth and exchanged that with misery and a wretched life. They have attacked these Divine regulations, so that they may turn humanity away from Allahís true religion, His straight path, and bliss in this world and the nextótoward which the final Messenger of all Divine messages came to give glad tidings and to invite all humanity to receive.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Muhammad the son of ëAbdullah is Allahís Prophet and the Final Messenger Sent by Allah to the Inhabitants of Earth<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
My brothers and sisters everywhere! You should know that the Messenger, Muhammad the son of ëAbdullah (may Allahís blessings and peace be upon him) is Allahís Messenger in reality and truth. The evidences that show his veracity are abundant. None but an infidel, who out of arrogance alone, could deny these signs.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Among these proofs:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
1.       Muhammad (may Allahís blessings and peace be upon him) was raised illiterate, unable to read or write, and remained like that till his death. Among all his people, he was known as being truthful and trustworthy. Before receiving revelation, he had no prior knowledge of Religion or any previously sent Message. He remained like that for his first forty years.<br />
<br />
Revelation then came to Muhammad with the Koran that we now have between our hands. This Koran mentioned most of the accounts found in the previous ************************ures, telling us about these events in the greatest detail as if he witnessed them. These accounts came precisely as they were found in the Torah sent down to Moses and in the Gospel sent down to Jesus. Neither the Jews or Christians were able to belie him regarding anything that he said.<br />
<br />
2.       Muhammad (may Allahís blessings and peace be upon him) also foretold of everything that would occur to him and his community after him, pertaining to victory, the removal of the tyrannical kingdoms of Chosroes[2] and Caesar, and the establishment of the religion of Islam throughout the earth. These events occurred exactly as Muhammad foretold, as if he was reading the future from an open book.<br />
<br />
3.       Muhammad (may Allahís blessings and peace be upon him) also brought an Arabic Koran that is the peak of eloquence and clarity. The Koran challenged those eloquent and fluent Arabs of his time, who initially belied him, to bring forth a single chapter like the Koran. The eloquent Arabs of his day were unable to contest this Koran.<br />
<br />
Indeed, till our day, none has ever dared to claim that he has been able to compose words that equalóor even approachóthe order, grace, beauty, and splendor of this Glorious Koran.<br />
<br />
4.       The life history of this Noble Prophet was a perfect example of being upright, merciful, compassionate, truthful, brave, generous, distant from all evil character, and ascetic in all worldly matters, while striving solely for the reward of the Hereafter. Moreover, in all his actions and dealings, he was ever mindful and fearful of Allah.<br />
<br />
5.       Allah instilled great love for Muhammad (may Allahís blessings and peace be upon him) in the hearts of all who believed in and met him. This love reached such a degree that any of his companions would willingly sacrifice his (or her) self, mother or father for him.<br />
<br />
Till today, those who believe in Muhammad honor and love him. Anyone of those who believe in him would ransom his own family and wealth to see him, even if but once.<br />
<br />
6.       All of history has not preserved the biography of any person in the manner it has preserved the life of Muhammad, who is the most influential human in history.<br />
<br />
Nor has the entire earth known of anyone whom every morning and evening, and many times thereafter throughout the day, is thought of by those who believe in him. Upon remembering Muhammad, the believers in him will greet him and ask Allah to bless him. They do such with full hearts and true love for him.<br />
<br />
7.       Nor has there every been a man on earth whom is still followed in all his doings by those who believe in him.<br />
<br />
Those who believe in Muhammad, sleep in the manner he slept; purify themselves (through ablution and ritual washing) in the manner he purified himself; and adhere to his practice in the way they eat, drink, and clothe themselves.<br />
<br />
Indeed in all aspects of their lives, the believers in Muhammad adhere to the teachings he spread among them and the path that he traveled upon during his life.<br />
<br />
During every generation, from his day till our time, the believers in this Noble Prophet have fully adhered to his teachings. With some, this has reached the degree that they desire to follow and adhere to the Prophetís way in his personal matters regarding which Allah has not sought of them to adhere to in worship. For example, some will only eat those specific foods or only wear those specific garments that the Messenger liked.<br />
<br />
Let alone all that, all those who believe in Muhammad repeat those praises of Allah, special prayers, and invocations that he would say during each of his actions during day and night, like: what he would say when he greeted people, upon entering and leaving the house, entering and leaving the mosque, entering and leaving the bathroom, going to sleep and awaking from sleep, observing the new crescent, observing the new fruit on trees, eating, drinking, dressing, riding, traveling and returning from travel, etc.<br />
<br />
Let alone all that, all those who believe in Muhammad fully performóeven to the minute detailóevery act of worshipólike prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimageóas this Noble Messenger (may Allahís blessings and peace be upon him) taught and as he himself performed.<br />
<br />
All of this allows those who believe in him, to live their lives in all aspects with this Noble Messenger as their example, as if he was standing before them, for them to follow in all their doings.<br />
<br />
8.       There has never been nor will there ever be a man anywhere upon this earth who has received such love, respect, honor, and obedience in all mattersósmall and large alikeóas has this Noble Prophet.<br />
<br />
9.       Since his day, in every region of the earth and during every period, this Noble Prophet has been followed by individuals from all races, colors and peoples. Many of those who followed him were previously Christians, Jews, pagans, idolaters, or without any religion. Among those who chose to follow him, were those who were known for their sound judgment, wisdom, reflection, and foresight. They choose to follow this Noble Prophet after they witnessed the signs of his truthfulness and the evidences of his miracles. They did not choose to follow Muhammad out of compulsion or coercion or because they had adopted the ways of their fathers and mothers.<br />
<br />
Indeed many of the followers of this Prophet (may Allahís blessings and peace be upon him), chose to follow him during the time when Islam was weak, when there were few Muslims, and when there was severe persecution of his followers on earth. Most people who have followed this Prophet (may Allahís blessings and peace be upon him) have done so not to acquire some material benefits. Indeed many of his followers have suffered the greatest forms of harm and persecution as a result of following this Prophet. Despite all this harm and persecution, this did not turn them back from his religion.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
My brethren! All of this clearly indicates to anyone possessing any sense, that this Prophet was truly and really Allahís messenger and that he was not just a man who claimed prophethood or spoke about Allah without knowledge.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
10.    With all this, Muhammad came with a great religion in its credal and legal make-up.<br />
<br />
Muhammad described Allah with qualities of complete perfection, and at the same time in a manner that is free of ascribing to Him any imperfection.. Neither the philosophers or the wise could ever describe Allah like such. Indeed it is impossible to imagine that any human mind could conceive of an existing being that possesses such complete ability, knowledge, and greatness; Who has subdued the creation; Who has encompassed everything in the universe, small or large; and Who possesses such perfect mercy.<br />
<br />
Nor is it in the ability of any human being to place a perfect law based upon justice, equality, mercy and objectivity for all human activity on earth like the laws that Muhammad brought for all spheres of human activityólike, buying and selling, marriage and divorce, renting, testimony, custody, and all other contracts that are necessary to uphold life and civilization on earth.<br />
<br />
11.    It is impossible that any person conceive wisdom, morals, good manners, nobleness of character as what this honorable Prophet (may Allahís blessings and peace be upon him) brought.<br />
<br />
In a full and complete manner, Muhammmad spread a teaching regarding character and manners toward oneís parents, relatives, friends, family, humanity, animals, plants and inanimate objects. It is impossible for the human mind alone to grasp all of that teaching or come with a similar teaching.<br />
<br />
All of that unequivocally indicates that this Messenger did not bring any of this religion from his own accord, but that it was rather a teaching and inspiration that he received from the One Who created the earth and the high heavens above and created this universe in its miraculous architecture and perfection.<br />
<br />
12.    The legal and credal make-up of the religion that the Messenger, Muhammad, (may Allahís blessings and peace be upon him) brought resembles the engineering of the heavens and the earth. All of that indicates that He who created the heavens and the earth is the One Who sent down this great law and upright religion.<br />
<br />
The degree of inimitability of the Divine law that was sent down upon Muhammad is to the same degree of inimitability of the Divine creation of the heavens and earth. For just as humanity cannot create this universe, in the same manner humanity cannot bring forth a law like Allahís law that He sent down upon His servant and messenger Muhammad (may Allahís blessings and peace be upon him).<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
A Single Verse from the Koran Suffices for the Bliss of All Humanity Were They to Adhere It<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
O my brothers and sisters everywhere! Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
O humanity! Be careful of your duty to your Lord, Who created you from a single soul, and from it created its mate, and from the pair of them has spread abroad many men and women; and be careful of your duty toward Allah in Whom you demand (your rights) of one another and [be careful of your duty] toward the wombs (that bare you); surely Allah ever watches over you.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Koran 4:1<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
∑         This is a call from Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to all humanity irrespective of their creeds or religions.<br />
<br />
∑         Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), the Lord and Creator, calls humanity to fear Him and to know that He has created them from a single soul, Adam, humanityís father (may Allahís peace and blessings be upon him). From Adam, Allah created his mate, and she is Eve. (It has been mentioned upon the tongue of the final Messenger and Prophet, Muhammad, who is truthful and believed in, that Allah took a rib from Adam and from it created his mate Eve.)<br />
<br />
Through the joining of every male and female from the offspring of Adam and Eve, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) made all of humanity (with the exception of Jesus (upon him Allahís mercy and peace) who was created by Allah, from the Virgin Mary without any father, but by Allahís Word[3] and the blowing of the angel of Jesusí soul into Mary.<br />
<br />
∑         After Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), the Lord, taught us that He created all of us from a single soul and commanded us that we fear Him; He then commands us a second time to observe our duty toward Him and warns us from cutting the ties of the womb.<br />
<br />
∑         The womb (or rahm in Arabic) is that place from where the child grows. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) derived for this organ a name from His names; Allah is ar-Rahman[4] and this organ is known as the rahm. This is so, because Allah calls us to be merciful with one another and in particular with those whom we are linked with by a single womb.<br />
<br />
For this reason among humans the mother is the most merciful as her child grew and developed in her womb. After the mother, the most merciful among humans is the father, as it was his seed that brought forth the fetus in the womb of the mother. After the parents, the most merciful are the full brothers and sisters as they all are joined by a single womb in which they grew and by one father who was their seed. After the siblings, the most merciful are half-brothers and half-sisters, who share the same mother, as they all are from a single womb even if their fathers are different; and then after them are half-brothers and half-sisters from a single father; and so forth.<br />
<br />
This mercy shared between all humanity is what distinguishes them from all animals.<br />
<br />
∑         For all of humanity is united by a single, distant womb, the womb of Eve, and are then united in closer wombs, like the womb that links brothers and sisters. This mercy shared by humanity is the greatest matter that Allah distinguished humans with from all other animals on earth.<br />
<br />
∑         Neither intelligence itself nor the ability to provide for oneís needs is what distinguishes humans from animals. The worms in the earth, the animals that crawl on the ground, the beasts and birds, each knows how to acquire the necessities for its existence, how to store its food, how to protect and raise its offspring; and how by its wits to reach the end of its natural life span provided no event terminates its life.<br />
<br />
∑         Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) then informs us in this verse that He is ever watchful over all of us.<br />
<br />
Among the meanings of His watchfulness over us is that He knows whatever we do during night or day, secretly or openly. Indeed Allah knows our thoughts and what our hearts conceal. Every instant He looks at us. Nothing is hidden from His Eyes that sleep not. He is acquainted with our secrets, He hears our words, and He enumerates our deeds.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Allah has appointed for us the system, law, and way that He required from us to follow in all our affairs. Allah revealed this system, law, and way to every generation and people upon the tongues of His messengers and prophets, whom He sent to humanity during every age, beginning with Adam (who was a prophet to whom Allah spoke) and concluding with Muhammad (who is Allahís messenger and prophet for all humanity from the moment that Allah sent him till the Hour of Judgment is established and these heavens and earth come to an end).<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Upon the basis of this system, law, and way that Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) sent down, He will judge us concerning we did. Did our actions agree with the truth and occur as Allah commanded and legislated for us? Or did we in this life travel according to our whims and desires and by what we legislated for our own selves and by what our minds devised?<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Equality of Men and Women in all Three Levels of the Islamic Religion<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
My brothers and sisters everywhere! Islamís lawóthat Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) sent down to His Messenger Muhammadócame to announce that women (exactly like men) are full human beings. Women (lmain_s.htmre therefore required to follow the way appointed by Allah.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
A woman (like a man) is therefore obligated with all three degrees of this religion: islam (outward submission to Allah), iman (inward faith in Allah), and ihsan (perfection of worship of Allah).<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
∑         It is thus required for every woman to testify that there is none deserving worship but Allah and that Muhammad is Allahís Messenger; to pray; to give charity; to fast; and to make a pilgrimage to Allahís House if she has the means.<br />
<br />
∑         It is likewise required for every woman to believe in Allah, His angels, His ************************ures, His messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in Allahís decree (and that the good and evil consequences thereof are from Allah).<br />
<br />
These are the fundamentals of islam and iman.<br />
<br />
∑         It is likewise required for every woman to worship Allah as if she sees Him. For although she cannot see Allah, she must believe that He sees whatever she does in secret and in public.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Women (exactly like men) have been commanded with these three levels of the religion (islam, iman, and ihsan).<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
∑         Women are also obligated to enjoin good and forbid evil; to wage jihad by saying that which is truthful; and to adhere to all noble behavior, like: truthfulness, trustworthiness, courage, modesty, and self-respect.<br />
<br />
∑         Every Muslim woman is commanded to be steadfast in her religion and not to be negligent with her faith. It is impermissible for heróunder any pressure or compulsionóto open her heart to accept the word of disbelief.[5] Hence every Muslim woman falls under Allahís statement:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Whoso disbelieves in Allah, after he has believedóexcepting him who has been compelled, and his heart is still at rest with the Faithóbut whosoeverís breast is expanded in unbelief, upon them shall rest anger from Allah, and there awaits them a mighty chastisement.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Koran 16:106<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Clearly when Islam charged women with all these duties and in all these obligations made her equal to men, the intent was to honor her and permit her reach the highest degree of perfection of her being.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
For the duties that Allah has obligated humanity with are but a means to honor us. Prayer, as well as fasting, is an honor for the servant and means to raise his rank. To adhere to Allahís straight path and the manners of Islam are, without doubt, means to honor us and not humiliate us as is imagined by those who are ignorant of Allah and follow their desires.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Such people think and imagine that a human being who does not believe in Allah, does not uphold the trust of these duties, and does not perform what Allah has commanded him is of a higher standing than the believer who adheres to the obligations of Islam. Such an idea is ignorance and renders human beings on par with the animals.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Humans have been created to be tried by Allah and have been charged with fulfilling these duties to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) and His creatures.[6] As for animals, while they have been by created by Allah, they have not been charged with this trust.[7]<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Whoever considers that human being who does not uphold what Allah has obligated an equal to those who fulfill what Allah has obligated is like those who consider humans and animals to be equal. For this reason, Allah has said:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Shall We then treat those who have surrendered (as Muslims) as We treat the guilty?<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Koran 68:35<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
And He has said:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
We have created for hell many of the jinn and humanity; they have hearts, but understand not with them; they have eyes, but perceive not with them; and they have ears, but they hear not with them. These are like cattle; nay, rather they are further astray! Thoseóthey are the heedless.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Koran 7:126<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The disbeliever in Allah is a guilty criminal, for he does not know whom He is to worship, his Creator, his Protector, his Lord, and He Who created this universe in which he lives. The disbeliever enjoys what Allah has blessed him with and yet forgets the One Who blessed and preferred him with such blessings. As for the believer, he is the honorable servant who knows His Lord, God whom He worships, and Creator. He fulfills what Allah has obligated and travels upon the path that Allah has delineated for him.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Islam and Womenís Work<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) lifted from women the obligation of working to provide and support herself and her family. He made this obligation particular for men alone. Allah commanded men to be responsible for the care of women during all stages of their life.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
∑         While she is a child, she is under the care of her father. This responsibility is not lifted except by her marriage or (his or her) death, nor does it cease after she reaches a certain age as occurs in the laws of the ignorant who rule by their desires and their shallow minds.<br />
<br />
∑         After she marries, the responsibility falls on her husband so long as she is under his care due to the contract of marriage.<br />
<br />
∑         If she has neither father or husband, the responsibility of her care falls on her brother who assumes the role of the father when he is not present; and if she has no brother then whoever is her closest male relative (from whom she would inherit and whom would inherit from her) would assume the role of her father.<br />
<br />
∑         If she has no male relatives, the obligation falls upon the Muslim community. The responsibility of her care is a communal obligation; if none fulfills that, all have sinned.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Furthermore even if she is wealthy, Islam has dropped from her the obligation of assuming care of anyone. With the presence of her husband (or for that matter her parents), it is not required that she spend upon her children unless she seeks to do such as an act of righteousness, kindness and observing ties of the womb. She is not obligated to work in order to take care of herself or her children.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
This lifting of the obligation of working for the purpose of providing for herself was in order to preserve her from being degraded, as many jobs that are sought to gain livelihood entail humiliation and hardship. Likewise this responsibility was lifted to preserve her from temptation and mixing with men and because this is from the specialization that Allah has made as a law for His creation.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
If women were charged to work in order to provide for their livelihood in addition to their natural duties of pregnancy, child birth, and breast feeding this would be an obligation above what she could bear and would be an injustice to women. Or this work would be at the expense of her natural duties of pregnancy, birth, breast feeding and raising her children. And this is what exactly has occurred with all nations that have deviated from what Allah has made a natural state among His creation.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
In these ignorant un-Islamic societies, men are pleased with this situation as this gains for them greater gratification with women and drops from them a considerable amount of the responsibility of working and supporting her and her children. This obviously is a selfish attitude on the part of men. Sadly many women are pleased with this situation, I mean gathering between working outside the house to support herself and her natural duties of pregnancy and child birth and breast feeding. This is because of her desire for amusement and to boast; not because there is any real human or moral value in her working outside the home. Unlike what is claimed, womenís work has no real value boosting the economy. Rather the truth is that by competing with men for jobs outside the home, women are a cause in the spread of unemployment and an increase in the useless consumption of cosmetics, clothes, and perfumes that have all become necessary items for women working outside the home. Furthermore every woman that works outside the home is in most occasions a cause for denying an opportunity for a man who could work in her place. Again this is one factor in unemployment. Moreover the man who takes the place of a woman in the household cannot substitute her in her natural duties.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
We say what is the economic, moral, or social value for women working in factories, armies, cleaning streets and airports, repairing trains, cleaning public restrooms, as a security guard, driving taxis, and all other occupations that humiliate women in those countries that live for this world alone and do not think of the Hereafter.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
This is all from the wretched life that Allah has warned whoever distances himself from His way. Allah (Exalted be He) has said:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
ì... but whosoever turns away from My rememberance, his shall be a life of narrowness, and on the Resurrection Day We shall raise him blind.î He shall say, ìO my Lord, why hast Thou raised me blind, when I was wont to see?î Allah shall say, ìSo [it must be]. Our signs came unto thee, and thou didst forget them; and in a like manner today thou art forgotten.î<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Koran 20:124<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Although Islam has not obligated women to work to seek a living and has appointed someone to be responsible for her during all her stages of her life; Islamic law has given women the right (so long as she has reached the age of maturity and is competent) to own and dispose of her properties without any guardianship over her (whether that be her father, husband or anyone else).<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
She has the right to own all forms of property, to buy and sell, give gifts and charity, and all forms of expenditure (without wastefulness) so long as it is her wealth and her acquisition. However if she is incompetent, Islam does not distinguish between men and women in declaring someone legally incompetent. Islam gave women the right to own and dispose of property, so that by this she could be a full legal personality possessing the full right to dispose of her wealth. Islam provides her with specific sources to acquire wealth, like the dower, inheritance, gifts, and all other lawful means for acquired wealth.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
As women in Islamic law are not required to maintain themselves or others, she was given half of what men receive in inheritance in observation that she is not responsible for the maintenance of anyone and to replenish menís wealth who alone are responsible to work and provide maintenance.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
In this Islam opposed the ignorant un-Islamic practice that forbade women to inherit under any circumstance because she does not maintain anyone or fight against any enemy. Allah sent down in His Glorious Koran:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
To the men [of a family] a share of what parents and near kindred leave, and to the women a share of what parents and near kindred leave, whether it be little or much, a share apportioned... .<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Koran 4:7<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Without doubt those who claim that Islam is unjust toward women because it gives her half of what men receive in inheritance are ignorant of the distribution of rights and obligations in the pure, just Islamic law.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Is the judgment of the pre-Islamic days of ignorance then that they are seeking? Yet who is better in judgment than Allah, for a people having certainty [in their faith]?<br />

Islamic Laws Governing Chastity<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Islamic law aims to preserve the six indispensable necessities (i.e., religion, life, mind, progeny, wealth, and character) that a human beingís bliss or a good life upon earth cannot be achieved except with their preservation.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Islam has legislated laws that aim to preserve each of these six necessities. What concerns us here for our discussion regarding the wisdom of Islam behind its specific legislations pertaining to women are the effects of these specific legislations upon preserving these six necessities and in particular the purity of oneís progeny and the correctness of his lineage to oneís parents thereby preserving the circle of relatives and the circle of the wombs. It is this lineage that distinguishes human beings on earth from all other animals.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The preservation of the purity of oneís progeny and the correctness of lineage to oneís parents is among those six indispensable necessities regarding which there is no bliss for humanity nor will humanity continue to exist without its preservation.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
In order to preserve oneís lineage to his parents:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
1.       Islam forbade that a man under any circumstance marry his mother, daughter, sister, aunt (paternal or maternal), niece (from his brother or sister), wifeís mother, his wifeís daughter (if he had sexual relations with her mother)[8] and the equivalents to these women to whom he is related by breast feeding, as Islamís messenger has said:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
What is unlawful by reason of lineage is forbidden by reason of fosterage.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The aim in forbidding marriage with these women is to preserve oneís lineage and the circle of wombs; and to allow men to become accustomed to a circle of women around him toward whom he feels no sexual desire, physical pleasure or possessiveness but rather toward whom he has feelings of love, mercy and respect. Hence the feeling a man has toward these women must be different than the feelings he has toward a woman whom he can marry and have sex.<br />
<br />
Accordingly, Islam forbade a woman under any circumstance to marry her father, son, brother, uncle (paternal or maternal), nephew (from her brother or sister), her husbandís father or son, and likewise the equivalents to these men to whom she is bound by breast feeding. This is so that a woman may feel toward these men feelings of closeness and love that are free of any sexual desire.<br />
<br />
2.       In order to preserve the lineage and make the circle of the womb pure and clean, Islam ordered that marriage be announced, certified, and witnessed so that it may be distinguished from illicit sexual relations. To preserve the honor of women, Islam required of her guardian to pursue the marriage contract for his charge (i.e., daughter, sister, etc.). Hence she does not negotiate with a man for herself like a woman engaging in adultery or fornication. In order to preserve a womanís dignity and guard her modesty and softness, her closest male relative settles the marriage contract for her.<br />
<br />
3.       Since illicit sexual intercourse is the plague that destroys the pure progeny and correct lineage, pure and good Islam (which is the law of Allah Who is All-Wise, Worthy of all praise) has by all means firmly closed and barred all doors leading to this plague. Islam cured this problem, before its occurrence; and has cured it after its occurrence (when it occurs) rooted it out and terminated all its effects on society. This is because the sexual instinct and natural inclination of men and women toward one another is among the strongest instincts if not the strongest. Both men and women are weak before this instinct and this desire.<br />
<br />
Without doubt that to fall into this plague and its spread means the destruction of the greatest ingredient for human bliss upon earth and that is purity of progeny and correct lineage. This will lead to destruction of the womb and the end of mercy. For with the spread of illicit sex there is a spread of illegitimate children. When there are many illegitimate children: the family comes to an end; the fabric of society is ripped apart; bonds of love are ended between societyís members; selfishness and narcissism becomes wide spread; and hatred and dislike is spread between people. The only feelings that remain are those of possessiveness, power, pleasure, pure self-interest, living for the moment and distancing of oneself from shouldering the responsibilities of marriage and raising children. This is a warning of the impending destruction, collapse, and loss of mercy, happiness and compassion.<br />
<br />
4.       In order to keep the progeny clean, the pure and good Islamic law ordered men and women to lower oneís glance from one another and commanded that women cover and hide their beauty from all men who are permitted to marry her.[9]<br />
<br />
5.       This Islamic law forbade a woman to travel alone without a guardian[10]. It forbade that anyone enter her household while her husband or guardians are not present or for men (with the exception of her husband or guardian) to remain in private with them. The intent behind all these regulations is to preserve honor, to keep away from the areas of temptation and doubt, and to preserve trust and peace of mind regarding chastity and uprightness.<br />
<br />
6.       Without doubt, that the Islamic regulations regarding chastity (such as the womenís dress code and others) were never a barrier for women to reach the highest degree of perfection possible for her in terms in all its branches of knowledge, virtue and righteousness. Indeed the womenís dress code is among the greatest means that free men and women to reach their aims, as they are not preoccupied with the other sex all the time. Practice shows that those students who are in single sex universities are more apt to learn than those in coeducational institutions.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
My brothers and sisters everywhere!<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
These regulations that Islam has legislated to preserve character and to guard the purity of offspring and correctness of lineage are opposed by those who follow their desires and are short sighted, those who want to live for their desires and their self interests even if this results in every evil and sin. The attack of these perverts on Islamic laws that govern chastity and the preservation of lineage was not as they claim out of their desire to protect women, her rights or to show justice to her. Rather their aim was to take women while still in their youth out of their homes so that she can be within their reach whenever and wherever they want, to deceive married women not to preserve the rights of her husband or guard her lineage, and to make a woman in every stage of her life a plaything and an object of pleasure for men that he may fulfill his sexual desire in every way and at the same time leave her to deal with what is in her womb, while he is free to have many as girl friends and passing lovers.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
In the end, women are left after pregnancy to shoulder all the responsibilities.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Either she will commit the crime of murdering her child prior to giving birth or after; or either she will give up her child to a foster home where it will raised far away from any family as animals are raised in shelters; or either she will throw her baby away in the trash. If there remains anything of her maternal instincts, she will try to find some means to take care of this child. She might look for another man to replace the first who after fulfilling his desires left her.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
This painful reality is what has resulted in the sinful, amoral societies wherein men claim that they want to preserve womenís rights and give her equality with men. This reality is the greatest proof that their claim that they seek equality is only a lie and a means of deception.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Women were the sacrificial ram for this call to ìequality.î For her to seek a livelihood has become a necessity of life and it is against her nature and constitution.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
A man is able to have sex with a thousand women and will never carry anything in his belly, and still will be able to have sex with a thousand more. While a woman might become pregnant during her first sexual experience with any passing man who seeks only gratification. She alone is held responsible for all the rest. She will either kill what lies in her belly or she will be responsible for all the maintenance and what follows. Where then is the equality?<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
In these societies, the un-Islamic ignorant contracts of marriage are no longer a guarantee for women. For if a man can find a woman whom he can enjoy without these guarantees and responsibilities, why should he turn to marriage with its restrictions and consequences? Moreover, since in these societies women have been made equal to men in the right to terminate marriage, these contracts do not remain but for the briefest period of time, sometimes not lasting more than a few hours. Again, where is the equality?<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Marriage in Islam<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
My brothers and sisters everywhere!<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I call you to learn about the marriage contract as it is set forth in the pure Islamic law that was sent down upon Allahís final prophet and His messenger, our master Muhammad (may Allahís peace and blessings be upon him).<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
In this contract their is such wisdom and perfection whereas it achieves bliss, peace, and security for all men and women upon this earth.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
In the [Islamic marriage contract], Allah distributed the rights and obligations between men and women in a just and wise manner. He has appointed for it a safety valve in the manís hand as He (Exalted be He) has said:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Women have such honorable rights as obligations, but men have a [single] degree above them.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Koran 2:228<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Without going into the details of this contract:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
∑         In the [Islamic] marriage contract, Allah obligated upon the man to provide the woman a dower[11] and maintenance which includes her food, housing, and clothing[12]. Allah placed maintenance of the children upon the husband alone. Allah absolved women from the responsibility of seeking a livelihood and the necessities of life for her or her children.<br />
<br />
∑         Allah required from the woman obedience and sincerity toward her husband, that to him alone she gives her all, and that she guard his dwelling as she has been entrusted with that.<br />
<br />
∑         As for sexual pleasure, each spouse is to have pleasure with the other.[13]<br />
<br />
∑         Among the rights that Allah gave to the man alone is the right to separate and divorce his wife. This was such in order to preserve the secrets of marriage, so that he is not forced to turn to injustice to the woman, degrade her, or spread her secrets.<br />
<br />
∑         Upon divorcing his wife, Allah required that a man maintain her for the waiting period (which if she is pregnant is until she gives birth; if she is menstruating for three periods; and for all others three months). In any case, he is forever responsible for the maintenance of her children. If she is going to raise the children, it is [also] his responsibility to maintain her. By that a woman is absolved from working or seeking the necessities of life while she is a wife or when as a mother she is raising [his] children after divorce.<br />
<br />
∑         Allah also gave women the right to leave the marriage contract. In this case, however, she must return to him the dower he gave her, unless he drops that condition.<br />
<br />
∑         Allah made the marriage contract ìa strong pledge,î[14] each one of them, man and woman, must legally uphold this bond in this world and will accordingly be judged in the Hereafter.<br />
<br />
∑         Islam gave men the right to marry up to four women at one time, provided he is able to maintain them all.[15] Of course, a woman who accepts this, accepts such willingly and out of consent. Allah- Glorified and Exalted be He-has permitted this, so that no woman would remain without a husband; no man would turn to illicit sex (for lawful means have been facilitated for him); and so that each child would have a correct lineage to its parents.<br />
<br />
Without doubt those who desired to restrict a man to a single wife, arguing for equality harshly reject that a man gather under his custody more than one woman; where unable to achieve that.<br />
<br />
Many men by instinct and nature cannot restrict themselves to one woman or else he will engage in illicit sexual intercourse. When the preachers of [this] ìfalseî equality wanted to oppose the natural way, it collided with them. This resulted in men taking girlfriends and lovers. Illicit sex spread, illegitimate children multiplied, and [human] suffering became widespread.<br />
<br />
Among this suffering is that men have turned to raping their children. The statistics regarding this are extremely frightful. What crime have these ìpreachers of equalityî brought to humanity that they have turned fathers into predatory beasts raping their daughters, offspring, and family members.<br />
<br />
This is what occurs in the closet. As for what openly occurs in public, those whose nature has been perverted are delightful, proud and boastful at the great number of wicked girlfriends and lovers they have. Yet they have a fit and haughtily reject that a man be permitted to have more than one chaste, pure wife for him alone. What a reversal of nature? And what a false claim that they seek equality between men and women?<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The truth of the matter is that it is impossible to have absolute equality between men and women in what is specific for each of them. So long as it is impossible to achieve absolute equality between men and women, it is required to distribute rights and obligations [between the spouses] according to the manner in which the Creator (Glorified and Exalted be He) has assigned each one.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
My brothers and sisters everywhere!<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I call you to affirm the marriage contract in Islam as Allah sent it down upon the final prophet and messenger, our master Muhammad (may Allahís peace and blessings be upon him). For when applied it is a guarantee to achieve the blessed, good life that every reasoning person hopes and strives for on this earth.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
An Appeal to Save Humanity<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
My brothers and sisters everywhere!<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
We appeal you to save humanity from the wickedness into which it has fallen as result of its distancing itself from Allahís way and religion and opposing His good and pure laws. We will remind you with some of the calamities that have befallen humanity due to its running behind its passions and traveling on Satanís path of temptation.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Among which:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
1.       The Murder of Oneís Offspring:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The crime of murdering children and offspring which now has reached appalling numbers as a result of abortions performed secretly or openly.[16] This is among the results of making lawful illicit sex and immorality, charging women with working for a living, and facilitating the means that allow men to get women as they want.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
2.       The Spread of Illicit Sex and Immorality:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The making lawful of illicit sex is a great crime against humanity. Every religion and religious law that Allah sent down from heaven has forbidden this hideous crime and has decreed for it the most severest punishment, specifically stoning, for any man or woman who previously was married and engages in illicit sexual intercourse.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
This punishment has come in the law sent down upon Moses (upon him peace) as mentioned in Deuteronomy 22:20-24 regarding the women who her husband consummates marriage with her and finds her not a virgin.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her fatherís house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she shall die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her fatherís house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the women, and the women: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
If a damsel that is a virgin be bethrothed unto a husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; then ye shall bring them both unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighborís wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Without doubt that this which has been sent down upon Moses (upon him peace) is the law that Jesus (upon him peace) brought; for Jesus came as a prophet, messenger, and ruler judging by the law of the Torah.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
As mentioned in the Gospel, Jesus (upon him peace) says:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called the great in the kingdom of heaven<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Matthew 5:17-19<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Messiah (upon him peace) came to command the honorable and forbid the dishonorable. Illicit sex is among the greatest of what he forbade. The Messiah is quoted as saying:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shall not commit adultery: But I say unto you. That whoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out: for it is profitable for thee that one of they members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off; for it is profitable for thee that one of they members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Matthew 5:27-30<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
As for the law that has been sent down upon Allahís final messenger, Muhammad the son of Abdullah (may Allahís peace and blessings be upon him); it came with complete purity for society from this evil plague of illicit sexual relations by closing its doors and all means that lead to it and terminating its deleterious effects and results.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
In the Koran sent down [upon the Prophet Muhammad], we find the statement of Allah (Blessed and Exalted be He):<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
And approach not illicit sex; surely it is an indecency, and evil as a way.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Koran 17:32<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
To these three laws more than one-half of the inhabitants of the earth adhere today. Many of them are proud that they ascribe to these laws. However the worshippers of their desires and the followers of Satan have set astray many of humanity from this guidance and light. The laws of Satan and the way of the Devil first came to make lawful for a man and a woman if they are consenting, single adults that they may commit this crime without it being considered a sin or evil. Then the world was increased in evil when the callers of equality announced that illicit sex is not a crime when done by any man or woman, married or single. That this is from oneís personal freedoms. By this they hastened the destruction of the world through the bringing forth of illegitimate children, the destruction of the family, and the destruction of the wombs rendering humanity (and it has become) into a group of cattle and beasts; indeed like swine which have no sense of jealousy or morality.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
3.       Child Molestation and Incest<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Among the greatest acts of perversion that the laws of Satan have brought about is child molestation and incest. The number of incidents have reached such a frightful percentage that warns of the destruction of civilization. The homes of the irreligious have become homes of criminal activity and predatory behavior. Lost are the ideals of a home being a repose, safety, and security. A fatherís attack upon his sons, his daughters, the raping of his children and relatives is among the most hideous of what the earth has witnessed from acts of corruption and perversion.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
4.       Conception by Any Means and the Bringing Forth of Illegitimate Children<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Without doubt by the permitting pregnancy by any means whether by the husband or others; the establishment of sperm banks; are among the greatest aggressions against humanity and the permitting of the bringing forth of a people that are not linked in descent to their fathers. This is the defilement of oneís progeny and the destruction of lineage. This will quickly result in ruin and destruction; as there will come forth generations of illegitimate children who do not know the meaning of mercy nor are members of humanity except outwardly. As for being inwardly human, it is that person who is attributed to a mother and father and lives within a circle of relatives and knows the meaning of family and harmony as this will not be present. And by this corruption, killing, and criminal behavior will become prevalent. It will become easy for a person to kill another person without blinking an eye or feeling any remorse in his heart or change of feeling.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
5.       The Abasement and Humiliation of Women<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
These unjust laws, that falsely call for equality, have attacked that it and taken out women from their covering and respect so that they may earn their livelihood by her own hand like men. It is an injustice to women, degraded her to the fullest, caused her to bear great weights, and has turned her into a cheap commodity that every wicked person and passing person may get hold off to throw away on the side of the road when finished.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
One time, a woman was exalted in her fathersí house. He would stand up for her needs. He would propose marriage on her behalf and men would seek of her hand from her guardian and paying her a dower. The husband was responsible for all her maintenance and if she gave birth, the maintenance of her children was upon her husband not her. When she becomes a mother it becomes her right upon her children, after the right of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). This is the woman that Allahís Islamic law has honored in this manner and now has become a degraded, cheap commodity indeed sold with every product. Today a woman is a cover girl and Satanís trap and passing enjoyment and a sadden women toiling outside the home and sadden inside the home being burdened with pregnancy and child birth and having to struggle and work to acquire a livelihood.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
All men and women are called to lift this injustice that has befallen upon women by such humiliation and degradation.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
A Word in Conclusion<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
After these brief words that I direct to every man and woman on earth, sincerely advising (and Allah knows) that I do not want reward or thanks but rather I say this following the example of the prophets and the messengers who sincerely advised their peoples and called them to Allah not seeking from them any reward.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Prophet Noah said to his people:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I convey unto you the Messages of my Lord, and I advise you sincerely; for I know from Allah that you know not.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Koran 7:62<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
While the Prophet Hood[17] said to his people:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I convey unto you the Messages of my Lord and am for you a true and sincere adviser.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Koran 7:68<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
In such manner, all prophets and messengers (upon them Allahís peace) have done.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
My words are from the heart. It is a call to believe in Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth (Glorified and Exalted is He) and for faith in all His great and noble messengers who were guides for humanity during every age and for faith in their seal, our master and prophet, Muhammad (may Allahís peace and blessings be upon him) who brought the complete and pure Islamic law ever remaining till the end of the world. It is the great Islamic law that guarantees bliss for all humanity upon earth.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
These words are also a warning against the great perversion that has spread throughout the earth today from behind destroying chastity and the family and the circle of the wombs. Even though in these diseases and plagues[18] Allah (Glorified and Exalted is He) has sent us warning after warning. If there is no stopping [this behavior] then let us wait the coming punishment. Allah (Exalted be He) has said:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Indeed We sent already to nations that were before thee, and We seized them with misery and hardship in order that they might grow humble. If only, when our disaster came upon them, they had been humble! But their hearts were hardened and Satan made all they used to do seem fair unto them. Then, when they forgot what they were reminded of, We opened unto them the gates of everything till; even as they were rejoicing in what they were given, We seized them suddenly, and behold, they were sore dumbfounded. So of the people who did wrong the last remnant was cut off. And all praise belongs to Allah, Lord of all Being.<br />

And say to the believing women, that they cast down their eyes and guard their private parts, and reveal not their adornment save such as is outward; and let them cast their headcoverings over the bosoms, and not reveal their adornment save to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husbandís fathers, or their sons, or their husbandís sons, or their brothers, or their brothersí sons, or their sistersí sons, or their women, or what their right hands own, or such men as attend to them, not having sexual desire, or children who have not yet attained knowledge of womenís private parts; nor let them stamp their feet, so that their hidden ornament may be known. And turn all together in repentance to Allah, O you believers; haply so you will prosper.<br />

O Emigrants, there are five things which may befall you and I pray Allah that you may escape them: moral decay never openly shows itself among a people but they suffer from pestilence and disease such as their fathers have never known; they do not use light weights and measures but they are smitten by famine and the injustice of rulers; they do not hold back the poor-tax from their herds but rain is withheld, for but the beasts there would be no rain sent; they do not break the covenant with Allah and His Messenger but an enemy is given power over them and takes much of their possessions; and their imams do not give judgment outside of Allahís Book and behave arrogantly in regard to what Allah has sent down but Allah brings upon them the calamity they have engendered.</div></div><hr />
