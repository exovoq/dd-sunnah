 <br />
Are these people really this far , from the correct methodology of Islaam ?<br />
 <br />
How can these people invent such lies and ascribe them to The Lord of Everything !!<br />
 <br />
It says :<br />
 <br />
From Abee Abdullaah who said : ëThe earth of the Kaíbah [Makkah] said : ëWho is like me? Indeed Allaah Has built His house on me, and people come to me -in flocks- from every valley, and I have been made a sacred sanctuary !?í <br />
 <br />
so Allaah revealed to it : ëthat you should stop and halt. As by my Capability and my Grandeur; what I have given you of excellence is nothing compared to what I have given to the earth of Karbalaa ; except the like of what a pin would take of the water when immersed in the ocean !  <br />
 <br />
And if it was not for the dust of Karbalaa I would not have given you any excellence. And if it was not for what the earth of Karbalaa has entailed; I would not have created you, and I would not have created the house [Ka'bah] of which you boast of!  So stay calm and stop, and be humble, and lowly towards the earth of Karbalaa , and do not be proud in front of the earth of Karbalaa :  If not, I would be angry with you and throw you into the Hell Fire. !î<br />
 <br />
end of quote.<br />
 <br />
May Allaah safeguard the blessed House and the blessed Land of Makkah, the Land of the beloved one of Allaah [Ibraahim] and his progeny , and also His beloved , the seal of the Prophets (may Allaah be pleased with them all).<br />
