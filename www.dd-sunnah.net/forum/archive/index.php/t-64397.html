<br />
I know mashallah that you know alot here.  I want to ask a question, Is it OK to Curse Yazeed?<br />
If not why, and who said it is not<br />
<br />
if there is already an article about it than I would love to read it, I can read arabic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ÇáÍÌÇÌ</div><div class="date">30-05-07, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assalamu alaikum wa Rahmatullah<br />
<br />
From what I know, it is not permissible to curse an individual person, rather you ask Allah to curse a certain type of people, such as the liars or the agressors, and the like<br />
<br />
Secondly, Amirul Mu'mineen Yazeed, may Allah bestow His mercy on him, has nothing to do whatsoever with the killing of al-Hussain Radiyallahu anh. It was the Shi'ites who actually killed him. in fact, for centuries, the Shi'ites failed to produce a single evidence, be it authentic or otherwise, proving that Yazeed ordered or directed the crime of killing al-Hussain. To the contrary, their own books show that Yazeed was disturbed by the news, and that he mourned along with his family, and returned Ali s/o al-Hussain back to al-Madinah with a protection, and he swore to him saying: &quot;By Allah I did not know nor did I order&quot; the killing<br />
<br />
Aside from all of this, we Muslims read<br />
<br />
&#1608;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1617;&#1614;&#1584;&#1616;&#1610;&#1606;&#1614; &#1580;&#1614;&#1575;&#1572;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575; &#1605;&#1616;&#1606; &#1576;&#1614;&#1593;&#1618;&#1583;&#1616;&#1607;&#1616;&#1605;&#1618; &#1610;&#1614;&#1602;&#1615;&#1608;&#1604;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614; &#1585;&#1614;&#1576;&#1617;&#1614;&#1606;&#1614;&#1575; &#1575;&#1594;&#1618;&#1601;&#1616;&#1585;&#1618; &#1604;&#1614;&#1606;&#1614;&#1575; &#1608;&#1614;&#1604;&#1616;&#1573;&#1616;&#1582;&#1618;&#1608;&#1614;&#1575;&#1606;&#1616;&#1606;&#1614;&#1575; &#1575;&#1604;&#1617;&#1614;&#1584;&#1616;&#1610;&#1606;&#1614; &#1587;&#1614;&#1576;&#1614;&#1602;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614;&#1575; &#1576;&#1616;&#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1573;&#1616;&#1610;&#1605;&#1614;&#1575;&#1606;&#1616; &#1608;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1575; &#1578;&#1614;&#1580;&#1618;&#1593;&#1614;&#1604;&#1618; &#1601;&#1616;&#1610; &#1602;&#1615;&#1604;&#1615;&#1608;&#1576;&#1616;&#1606;&#1614;&#1575; &#1594;&#1616;&#1604;&#1617;&#1575;&#1611; &#1604;&#1617;&#1616;&#1604;&#1617;&#1614;&#1584;&#1616;&#1610;&#1606;&#1614; &#1570;&#1605;&#1614;&#1606;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575; &#1585;&#1614;&#1576;&#1617;&#1614;&#1606;&#1614;&#1575; &#1573;&#1616;&#1606;&#1617;&#1614;&#1603;&#1614; &#1585;&#1614;&#1572;&#1615;&#1608;&#1601;&#1612; &#1585;&#1617;&#1614;&#1581;&#1616;&#1610;&#1605;&#1612; <br />
<br />
Whereas Yazeed [rah] has preceeded us in Iman, and we pray that Allah place no hatred in our hearts for those who believed<br />
<br />
As such, it is not lawful to curse him. Better yet, why not ask Allah His forgiveness to all the believers <br />
<br />
And Allah [swt] knows best</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all alhamdullilah we the people of tawheed from ahlul sunnah believes in this, but why do other sunnis believe that he was a nasibi and the cause of the killing of al-husain as<br />
<br />
Also is it true that he used to drink whine, and do alot of bad deeds. <br />
<br />
I will inshallah post evidence if needed. <br />
<br />
I also ask you brother to post a link to the topic of cursing yazeed and if it is allowed, or an audio of a shaikh speaking about it, inshallah that would be useful for me so I could answer the rafidis back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but why do other sunnis believe that he was a nasibi and the cause of the killing of al-husain <br />
<br />
Any charge, at any court of law, requires a solid &amp; a concrete evidence to substantiate the claim The charge that he was a &quot;Nasibi&quot; is a false charge &amp; lacks such an evidence. Allah [swt] says in His Glorious Book: Şõáú åóÇÊõæÇú ÈõÑúåóÇäóßõãú Åöä ßõäÊõãú ÕóÇÏöŞöíäó . So until such an evidence is produced, the charge is not worth looking at<br />
<br />
Also is it true that he used to drink whine, and do alot of bad deeds<br />
<br />
This is a no-less false charge than the previous one. It suffices not that such a charge is to be found in this or that book. What suffices is to bring forth such an evidence with a sound Isnaad. It is worthy to note here, that the history of Islam, from Prophethood down to the end of the Umayyid Dynasty was written during the Abbaside rule, who bore a tremendous enmity to their Umayyid counterpart. Furthermore, Shi'ite historians during the said period played a major role in spreading such a lies and propaganda<br />
<br />
I also ask you brother to post a link to the topic of cursing yazeed and if it is allowed, or an audio of a shaikh speaking about it, inshallah that would be useful for me so I could answer the rafidis back<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bint-alsunnah</div><div class="date">02-06-07, 01:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ibn Taymiyah said: ''However, the third view &#8211; which is the moderate one - is that he was one of the kings of the Muslims, who did good deeds and bad deeds. He was not born until the caliphate of `Uthman. He was not a Kafir, but it was because of him that the killing of Al-Husayn took place, and he did what he did to the people of Al-Harrah. He was not a Sahabi, nor was he one of the righteous devotees of Allah. This is the view of most of the people of reason and knowledge and of Ahl Al-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah.'' <br />
<br />
''Muslim was ordered to ransack Medina for three days. Yazeed committed a major sin. Sahaba and their children were slaughtered openly; other heinous acts were also perpetuated. We have already mentioned that he had Ibn Ziyad kill the grandson of Rasulullah (s) Husayn and his companions. In those three days in Madina, it is difficult to mention the type of acts that were carried out. By doing this act Yazeed wanted to secure his governance, in the same way Allah (swt) broke the neck of every Pharoah, the true King (swt) also broke the neck of Yazeed.&quot; <br />
...<br />
<br />
&quot;Rasulullah (s) said whoever perpetuated injustice and frightened the residents of Medina, the curse (la'nat) of Allah (swt), His Angels and all people is on such a person [4]<br />
(Al Bidayah wa al-Nihayah Volume 8 page 222)<br />
This is the book of ibn Kathir where there is alot more about Yazeed, so what is this true? <br />
<br />
Thanks for the links brother, I will take a look at it, and maybe I will get answers there.<br />

He was the king that time and got all the power to recruit the commanders and soldiers who had to protect the state. Well a king can give clear orders not to hurt Emam Hussein. To protect the state from the grandson of the prophet, that's a real paradox. There were so many ways to solve the problem instead of violence. Yazeed could call for a compromise in a peaceful way like did his Father with Eman El Hassan. Nowadays American soldiers are torturing iraqi people and muslims in Guantanamo, shal we say that Bush is innocent ? Not at All.<br />
<br />
Yazeed very simply made a big mistake. <br />
<br />
About cursing him or not, as Emam Ibn Taymiya said We do not curse him individually neither we love him.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ÇáÍÌÇÌ</div><div class="date">02-06-07, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I reiterate my position on this subject, that Yazeed [rah] has been misjudged by the historians. That the fact remains, any and every statement made by any person is subject to be true or false except those made by the Messenger [saw]. Having said this, I must say that it was to his misfortune that al-Husain [ra] was killed during his reign, but that has no weight when it comes to be fair to him. <br />
<br />
First of all, Allah [swt] says: <br />
<br />
æóáÇó ÊóßúÓöÈõ ßõáøõ äóİúÓò ÅöáÇøó ÚóáóíúåóÇ æóáÇó ÊóÒöÑõ æóÇÒöÑóÉñ æöÒúÑó ÃõÎúÑóì Ëõãøó Åöáóì ÑóÈøößõã ãøóÑúÌöÚõßõãú İóíõäóÈøöÆõßõã ÈöãóÇ ßõäÊõãú İöíåö ÊóÎúÊóáöİõæäó <br />
<br />
&quot;Each soul earneth only on its own account, nor doth any laden bear another's load. Then unto your Lord is your return and He will tell you that wherein ye differed.&quot;<br />
<br />
We know, from the facts available to us, that Yazeed [ra] had no role nor a knowledge whatsoever in what took place. His instruction to Obaidullah bin Ziyad was explicit and to the point: Prevent al-Hussain from entering al-Kufah. Politically, this is the right decision to be taken to prevent political instability and/or blood shed among Muslims. The Battle of Camel and the Battle of Nahrawan were fresh in mimory.<br />
<br />
Secondly, regarding the battle of al-Harra, we know that people of al-Madinah had given their pledge initially to Yazeed [rah]. We furthermore know, that the Messenger [saw] said:<br />
<br />
ÃóäóÇ ÂãõÑõßõãú ÈöÎóãúÓò Çááøóåõ ÃóãóÑóäöí Èöåöäøó ÈöÇáúÌóãóÇÚóÉö æóÈöÇáÓøóãúÚö æóÇáØøóÇÚóÉö æóÇáúåöÌúÑóÉö æóÇáúÌöåóÇÏö İöí ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö İóÅöäøóåõ ãóäú ÎóÑóÌó ãöäú ÇáúÌóãóÇÚóÉö ŞöíÏó ÔöÈúÑò İóŞóÏú ÎóáóÚó ÑöÈúŞóÉó ÇáúÅöÓúáóÇãö ãöäú ÚõäõŞöåö Åöáóì Ãóäú íóÑúÌöÚó æóãóäú ÏóÚóÇ ÈöÏóÚúæóì ÇáúÌóÇåöáöíøóÉö İóåõæó ãöäú ÌõËóÇ Ìóåóäøóãó ŞóÇáõæÇ íóÇ ÑóÓõæáó Çááøóåö æóÅöäú ÕóÇãó æóÕóáøóì ŞóÇáó æóÅöäú ÕóÇãó æóÕóáøóì æóÒóÚóãó Ãóäøóåõ ãõÓúáöãñ İóÇÏúÚõæÇ ÇáúãõÓúáöãöíäó ÈöãóÇ ÓóãøóÇåõãú ÇáúãõÓúáöãöíäó ÇáúãõÄúãöäöíäó ÚöÈóÇÏó Çááøóåö ÚóÒøó æóÌóáøó<br />
<br />
Reported by Ahmad.<br />
<br />
As such, the rebellion that took place in al-Madinah was in a clear violation of the Messenger's [saw] command. <br />
<br />
Note his words <br />
(ÃóäóÇ ÂãõÑõßõãú ÈöÎóãúÓò Çááøóåõ ÃóãóÑóäöí Èöåöäøó) <br />
to realize that the burden of the matter is on them not him<br />
<br />
He [saw] further said:<br />
<br />
ÍóÏøóËóäóÇ ãõÓóÏøóÏñ ÍóÏøóËóäóÇ ÚóÈúÏõ ÇáúæóÇÑöËö Úóäú ÇáúÌóÚúÏö Úóäú ÃóÈöí ÑóÌóÇÁò Úóäú ÇÈúäö ÚóÈøóÇÓò Úóäú ÇáäøóÈöíøö Õóáøóì Çááøóåõ Úóáóíúåö æóÓóáøóãó ŞóÇáó ãóäú ßóÑöåó ãöäú ÃóãöíÑöåö ÔóíúÆğÇ İóáúíóÕúÈöÑú İóÅöäøóåõ ãóäú ÎóÑóÌó ãöäú ÇáÓøõáúØóÇäö ÔöÈúÑğÇ ãóÇÊó ãöíÊóÉğ ÌóÇåöáöíøóÉğ<br />
<br />
Reported by al-Bukhari<br />
<br />
Can anyone then claim that their rebellion was inspired by the guidance of the Messenger [saw]? It certainly wasn't. And Allah knows best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are so many hadeeth shows that yazeed was a bad person and I will give you some hadeeth from alsunnah books<br />
Yazeed was drinking wine, playing with dogs and monkeys, killing the life of people <br />
and he did the worse thing in the life he was fighting with the grandson of prophet Muhammed who is al Husain to keep al Husain accept him as a Governor <br />
But al Husain never ever accept unfairness so the result was yazeed killing al Husain the grandson of prophet Muhammed in the most egregious way<br />
<br />
Now I will give you some evidences from alsunnah books:<br />
<br />
Ibn Katheer said in his History: (Yazeed was drunk and Mua'awiaah wanted to advise him so he said to him you can reach your desires without something takes your value and mentality...)<br />
<br />
Ibn katheer said also: (Yazeed was following the Appetites, leaving some prayers and leaving all prayers most of the time)<br />
<br />
Ibn Katheer in his History said: (He was dissolute he killed al Husain and created much known verses Poetry...) Ibn Katheer said these verses Poetry but I can't transolate them to English I can sent them to you in Arabic if you wish<br />
At the end I think there is no way for any doubt in cursing Yazeed<br />

<br />
From what I know, it is not permissible to curse an individual person, rather you ask Allah to curse a certain type of people, such as the liars or the agressors, and the like<br />
<br />
Secondly, Amirul Mu'mineen Yazeed, may Allah bestow His mercy on him, has nothing to do whatsoever with the killing of al-Hussain Radiyallahu anh. It was the Shi'ites who actually killed him. in fact, for centuries, the Shi'ites failed to produce a single evidence, be it authentic or otherwise, proving that Yazeed ordered or directed the crime of killing al-Hussain. To the contrary, their own books show that Yazeed was disturbed by the news, and that he mourned along with his family, and returned Ali s/o al-Hussain back to al-Madinah with a protection, and he swore to him saying: &quot;By Allah I did not know nor did I order&quot; the killing<br />
<br />
Aside from all of this, we Muslims read<br />
<br />
æóÇáøóĞöíäó ÌóÇÄõæÇ ãöä ÈóÚúÏöåöãú íóŞõæáõæäó ÑóÈøóäóÇ ÇÛúİöÑú áóäóÇ æóáöÅöÎúæóÇäöäóÇ ÇáøóĞöíäó ÓóÈóŞõæäóÇ ÈöÇáúÅöíãóÇäö æóáóÇ ÊóÌúÚóáú İöí ŞõáõæÈöäóÇ ÛöáøÇğ áøöáøóĞöíäó ÂãóäõæÇ ÑóÈøóäóÇ Åöäøóßó ÑóÄõæİñ ÑøóÍöíãñ <br />
<br />
Whereas Yazeed [rah] has preceeded us in Iman, and we pray that Allah place no hatred in our hearts for those who believed<br />
<br />
As such, it is not lawful to curse him. Better yet, why not ask Allah His forgiveness to all the believers <br />
<br />
And Allah [swt] knows best<br />
<br />
[You say that Yazeed had nothing to do with the killing in Karbala I may agree with you on this-for argument sake- but did he punish the people who were involved in the massacre?<br />
You call  Yazeed &quot;Ameer AlMomeneen, prove it?<br />

Apparantly, you've forgotten the fact that al-Hussain [ra] was killed in the battlefield not assasinated. As such, there is no punishment to be inflicted on no one. Unlike the murder of Othman [ra], that was clearly an assasination and the murderers deserve killing. I hope I've answered your question.</div></div><hr />

if that's the case no body should be hanged or punished for killing someone else!!!!!!<br />
because this will not make the deceased alive<br />

<br />
 AND Obviously you have forgotten that all history books mention the killers by name, but it’s really funny the way you analyze the incident, my friend one person killed Al-Hussain or ten or Thousand it does not matter because punishment is independent of number of killers</div></div><hr />

I HIGHLY suggest that we start from the beginning before continuing this dialogue any further<br />
<br />
Who killed/ordered the killing of Al-Hussain - May Allah be please with him <br />
<br />
?? <br />
<br />
(and where is the evidence for such claim - from the Shia sources)<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Sheik Al-Islam ibn Taymeyah has said :<br />
<br />
&quot; May the curse of Allah, the angels and the people be upon the killers of Al-Hussain and whoever has helped with this massacre and whoever was pleased with it &quot;</div></div><hr />

This sentence does not make sense, because it's not a good justification for not punishing the killers<br />

Actually you are making no sense. Did someone break the rules of engagement, and as such deserves to put on trial or executed? I don't understand where you're coming from. Can you elaborate and put in a plain black &amp; white? x<br />
<br />
We are before two forces, two groups of people, both anticipating fight to errupt at any time. It wasn't like al-Hussain [ra] was sitting home and someone budge-in 'n murdered him. It was a battle in a battlefield. If the case was as you've said, Muslim scholars would've raised the issue centuries ago. But the fact that they didn't, is because there is no case to begin with. Hope you understand now. Kabish senior? x</div></div><hr />

I am not aware of any Muslim scholar, regardless of his position on Yazeed [rah], ever disputed the fact that he is Ameerul-Mu'mineen by virtue of holding the highest office - the Grand Khilafat. Can you show us otherwise? I would really appreciate it. x</div></div><hr />

so the title comes with position, this means you would call a person with bad reputation   Ameer Al-moumeneen if he became your leade, furthermore, do you consider Yazeed as the fifth Khalifat because I have never heard of this openion</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The first man ever to be called Amirul-Mu'mineen was Omar [ra]. Hence everyone came after holding the position of Khalifah was titled Amirul-Mu'mineen, or something to that effect. I certainly, have no problem with Yazeed [ra] holding that office or that title.x<br />
<br />
As for Yazeed [ra], he's either the 6th or 7th Caliph depends if you consider al-Hasan's [ra] period as a Caliph. May Allah be pleased with them all. x</div></div><hr />

There's absolutely no harm in having a preference for al-Hussain. Who in the world wouldn't? x<br />
<br />
What we are after is to open your eyes to the fact that it was the Shi'ites who killed al-Hussain [ra]. Your own historians stress on this fact in their books. x<br />
<br />
We love Ahlul-Bayt more than you can imagine, but we tie our love to them with the Shari'ah codes &amp; restrictions. i.e w/o goining into excess and exageration.</div></div><hr />

Let me Take this opportunity to thank you brothers for giving us the opportunity to defend The Sunna of our beloved Prophet (peace be upon him) and to speak freely in plain english in this division or forum.<br />
<br />
About Yazeed May ALLAH be pleased with him, Is that ,as long as I am concerned, we should not curse him.<br />
<br />
Even if he have done things that is considered sinful, argumentativly, he is a muslim and he did not do something that makes him a defected man or an apostate.<br />
<br />
This is what I think and what I really believe.<br />
<br />
I wish that my brothers correct me if I am wrong concerning this topic.<br />
<br />
Thank you and May ALLAH bless you with paradise</div></div><hr />

<br />
He did not commit any act of apostasy, x<br />
<br />
It is not lawful to curse an individual in particular, x<br />
<br />
Vilivication of Yazeed leads to the vilivication of the Messenger [saw] who gave the glad tiding to the first armed forces invade Constantinople that their sins are forgiven. No one ever disputed the fact that Yazeed [rah] was at  head of that force. x<br />
<br />
As such, cursing Amirul-Mu'mineen can only cause the curser to be cursed. Instead, we ask Allah [swt] always to bestow His Mercy on everyone testified to His sole Divinity. x</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that this is the method of Islam and the prophet and his companions (May Allahs peace, blessings and mercy be upon them) and this is why there is a big difference between us and the shiites on the right method, because clearly the assume that they follow the the kinsfolk of the Prophet's house, and they are not, because the kinsfolks of the Prophet's house manners are uttermost superior, and the shiites have no manners at all even with his wives</div></div><hr />
