Asalaamu Aleikum,<br />
I have another question, and this is about the Jews and their relationship with the Rafidhah.  In the official medai, I am supposed to believe that the two are enemies. (for example, S. lebanon, syria, and Iran vs. Israel),  but then I hear and see other things that indicate they are actually (see photo) friends.<br />
<br />
For example, I read recently about the release of those Israeli Jewish spies in Iran<br />
<br />
Thank You<br />
Wasalaam</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StraightPath</div><div class="date">11-07-03, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They are only good at talk but when it comes to actions, they are VERY different from what they say, they also say ( without announcing it ) that the dead in Palestine are in hell, in this life and afterlife, and the true matrys are their shias even if they died on their beds.<br />
So dont let what they announce trick you, as the shiekh of Islam Ibn taymiyyah said Subhan the one who created lying and gave 9/10 of it to the shias.<br />
Also dont mix between their so-called resistance and reality, they just want to have influence in the region, nothing more.<br />
Think about it, throughout history, they fought NO ONE except for the sunnis! and did not spread Islam in any land, and never fought the kuffar, unless if they were attacked, and even then they wouldnt &quot;really&quot; fight when you look into the details, ironic, isnt it?</div></div><hr />
