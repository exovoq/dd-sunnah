<br />
The First Woman / Eve Christianity (Bible) <br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;When the woman (Eve) saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband (Adam), who was with her, and he ate it...Then the man (Adam) and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden. But the Lord God called to the man, &quot;Where are you?&quot; He (Adam) answered, &quot;I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.&quot; And he (God)  said, &quot;Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?&quot; The man said, &quot;The woman (Eve) you put here with me-she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.&quot; Then the Lord God said to the woman, &quot;What is this you have done?&quot; The woman said, &quot;The serpent deceived me, and I ate.&quot; To the woman he (God) said, &quot;I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing; with pain you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.&quot; To Adam he (God) said, &quot;Because you listen to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat of it,' &quot;Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Genesis 3:6-17 <br />
 Islam (Quran) <br />
 <br />
<br />
(God said):&quot;O Adam! You and your wife dwell in the Garden, and enjoy (its good things) as you wish: but do not approach this tree, or you run into harm and transgression.&quot; &quot;Then began Satan to whisper suggestions to them (Adam and Eve), bringing openly before their minds all their shame that was hidden from them (before): he (Satan) said: &quot;Your Lord only forbade you this tree, lest you should become angels or such beings as live for ever.&quot; &quot;And he (Satan) swore to them both, that he was their sincere adviser.&quot; &quot;So by deceit he brought about their (Adam and Eve) fall: when they tasted of the tree, their shame became manifest to them, and they began to sew together the leaves of the Garden over their bodies. And their Lord called to them: &quot;Did I not forbid you that tree, and tell you that Satan was an avowed enemy to you?&quot; &quot;They said: &quot;Our Lord! We have wronged our own souls: if You do not forgive us and do not bestow upon us Your Mercy, we shall certainly be lost&quot;  <br />

The Female Spiritual Essence<br />
<br />
&quot;I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a trap and whose hands are chains. The man who pleases God will escape her, but the sinner she will ensnare.&quot; &quot;Look,&quot; says the Teacher, &quot;this is what I have discovered: &quot;Adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things-while I was still searching but not finding- I found one upright man among a thousand, but not one upright woman among them all.&quot;  <br />
Ecclesiastes 7:26-28 <br />
 &quot;And Allah sets forth, as an example to those who believe, the wife of Pharaoh: behold she said: 'O my Lord! build for me, in nearness to You, a mansion in the Garden, and save me from Pharaoh and his doings, and save me from those that do wrong,&quot; &quot;And Mary the daughter of Imran, who guarded her chastity; and We breathed into (her body) of Our spirit; and she testified to the truth of the words of her Lord and of His Revelations, and was one of the devout (servants).&quot;  <br />
Quran 66:11-2 &quot;Heaven is at the feet of the mothers.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Prophet Mohammed <br />
 <br />
<br />
Menses<br />
&quot;When a woman has her regular flow of blood, the impurity of her monthly period will last seven days, and anyone who touches her will be unclean till evening. anything she lies on during her period will be unclean, and anything she sits on will be unclean. Whoever touches her bed must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean till evening. Whoever touches anything she sits on must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean till evening. Whether it is the bed or anything she was sitting on, when anyone touches it, he will be unclean till evening.&quot;  <br />
Leviticus 15:19-23 <br />
 <br />
Ali asked the Prophet Mohammed if when a man and a woman make love then their clothes stick to them from the sweat of their bodies, or if when a woman has her period her clothes stick to her body, are the clothes considered unclean?  <br />

Dressing Modesty / Head Covering<br />
&quot;Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head...If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head&quot;  <br />

Quran 33:59  ...they (believing women) should not display their beauty and ornaments except what (must ordinarily) appear thereof; that they should draw their veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women...or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex...&quot;  <br />
