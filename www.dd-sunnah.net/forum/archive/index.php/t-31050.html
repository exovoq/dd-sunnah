<br />
Why they called them selves Shittes Ali may Allah be pleased with him, which means  Ali's may Allah be pleased with him followers? What about the Prophet Mohammed peace be upon him, the final messenger of Allah? Why Allah Tal'a sent Prophets &amp; Messengers? <br />
<br />
Allah Tal'a had been sending Prophets and Messengers to his devote to in order to invite them to the worship of Allah and Allah Alone, t order them not to ascribe partners unto Him and bring them out of the darkness of polytheism into the light of Monotheism. Allah Tal'a said:- &quot;And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): Worship Allah (Alone) and avoid (or keep away from) T‚gh˚t (all false deities etc. i.e. do not worship T‚gh˚ts besides Allah).&quot; (V. 16:36).</div></div><hr />

Indeed, why are they calling themselves Shi'ites of Ali not Shi'ites of the Messenger [saw]? The answer is pretty clear, and that's because they don't follow the Sunnah of the Messenger [saw], so how can they be his Shi'ites? To overcome this issue, they made up a (sunnah) for their Imams and said they're following them. Oh Well !!</div></div><hr />
