<br />
I witnesed lot of people who dont speak arabic, are using this hadeeth to show how hard and awful the punishment of people who delay or destain a prayer<br />
<br />
so, I found lot of resources that showed us the weakness of this hadeeth, but i didnt finnd a lot of evidnece in english<br />
<br />
so, the one that i found it is posted in very trustful website<br />
which show people , how weak the hadeeth is, <br />
and instead, they provided us with other hadeeths which are similar in awaring people in the importance of prayers, but in different words, and they are ture<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How sound is the hadeeth, ìWhoever neglects prayer, Allaah will send fifteen punishments upon himî? <br />
My question is regarding these hadiths i was given in an email. <br />
I just want to know if they are authentic before i pass them on. Jazakallah. <br />
HADITH OF PROPHET (P.B.U.H) <br />
The one who disdains the prayers will receive fifteen punishments from Allah. Six punishments in this lifetime Three while dying , Three in the grave &amp; Three on the Day of Judgement.   <br />
THE SIX PUNISHMENTS OF LIFE:   <br />
1. Allah takes away blessings from his age(makes his life misfortunate)   <br />
2.Allah does not accept his plea(Du'aa)   <br />
3.Allah erases the features of good people from his face.   <br />
4.He will be detested by all creatures on earth.   <br />
5.Allah does not award him for his good deeds.(No thawab)   <br />
6.He will not be included in the Du'aa of good people.   <br />
THE THREE PUNISHMENTS WHILE DYING:   <br />
1. He dies humiliated.   <br />
2. He dies hungry.   <br />
3. He dies thirsty. Even if he drinks the water of all seas he will still be thirsty.   <br />
THE THREE PUNISHMENTS IN THE GRAVE:   <br />
1. Allah tightens his grave until his chest ribs come over each other. <br />
2. Allah pours on him fire with embers.   <br />
3. Allah sets on him a snake called &quot;the brave&quot;,&quot;the bold&quot;   <br />
which hits Him from morning until afternoon for leaving Fajr prayer,from the afternoon until Asr for leaving Dhuhr prayer and so on.With each strike he sinks 70 yards under the ground.   <br />
THE THREE PUNISHMENTS ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT:  <br />
1. Allah sends who would accompany him to hell pulling him on the face.   <br />
2. Allah gives him an angry look that makes the flesh of his face fall down.   <br />
3. Allah judges him strictly and orders him to be thrown in hell. <br />
<br />
Praise be to Allaah.   <br />
<br />
Firstly: <br />
<br />
The hadeeth, ìWhoever neglects prayer, Allaah will send fifteen punishments upon him, six in this world, three when he is dying, three in the grave and three when he emerges form the graveÖî is a fabricated (mawdooí) hadeeth which is falsely attributed to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). <br />
<br />
Concerning this hadeeth Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, in the magazine al-Buhooth al-Islamiyyah (22/329): With regard to the hadeeth which the author of this pamphlet attributes to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) concerning the punishment of the one who does not pray, and which says that fifteen punishment will be sent upon him etc., this is one of the fabricated ahaadeeth that are falsely attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as was stated by the scholars (may Allaah have mercy on him) such as al-Haafiz al-Dhahabi in Lisaan al-Meezaan, and al-Haafiz ibn Hajar and others. <br />
<br />
Similarly the Standing Committee issued a fatwa, no. 8689, declaring this hadeeth to be false, as it says in Fataawa al-Lajnah, 4/468. Among the things mentioned in this fatwa which it is worth quoting here is: <br />
<br />
What has been narrated from Allaah and from His Messenger concerning the punishment of the one who does not pray is sufficient. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <br />
<br />
ìVerily, As&#8209;Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hoursî<br />
<br />
[al-Nisaí 4:103] <br />
<br />
And Allaah says of the people of Hell (interpretation of the meaning): <br />
<br />
ì ëWhat has caused you to enter Hell?í<br />
<br />
They will say: ëWe were not of those who used to offer the Salaah (prayers)íî<br />
<br />
[al-Muddaththir 74:42-43] <br />
<br />
and He mentioned among their attributes the fact that they did not pray. <br />
<br />
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ìThe covenant that stands between us and them is prayer; whoever gives up prayer is a kaafir.î Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2621; al-Nasaaíi, 431; Ibn Maajah, 1079. classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2113. And there are other verses and ahaadeeth which speak of giving up prayer, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described it as kufr. <br />
<br />
See also question no. 2182. <br />
<br />
Shaykh Ibn ëUthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This hadeeth is mawdooí (fabricated) and falsely attributed to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It is not permissible to propagate it unless it is accompanied by a statement that it is fabricated, so that the people will have a clear understanding about it. <br />
<br />
Fataawa al-Shaykh published by the Dawíah center in ëAnayzah, 1/6 <br />
<br />
We ask Allaah to make you steadfast in your keenness to call your brothers and advise them, but you have to make it clear to everyone who is keen to do good for the people and to warn them against evil that it must be done in accordance with that which is proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and that there is sufficient material in the saheeh reports that we have no need for the daíeef (weak) material. <br />
<br />
We ask Allaah to grant you success and to guide those whom you call and all the Muslims to follow the straight path. <br />
<br />
And Allaah knows best.<br />
