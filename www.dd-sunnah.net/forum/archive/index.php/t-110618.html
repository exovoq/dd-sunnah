<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">«»Ê ⁄„— «·ﬂ‰œÌ</div><div class="date">26-10-10, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A grassroots campaign driven by volunteers has delivered Canada its first Muslim mayor ñ Mr. Nenshi, who scored a staggering win in Calgaryís mayorís race Monday.<br />
<br />
He defeated two better-funded candidates, including one backed by Stephen Harperís campaign team, and saw his support surge in the final few weeks. To say Mr. Nenshi's campaign was austere is understatement ñ he delivered his speech in a basement that was donated by a supporter at the last second.<br />
<br />
The 38-year-old Mr. Nenshi survived a smear campaign and a telephone failure in the crucial final days and hours, before running away with what was to be a close vote. His candidacy was branded the ìPurple Revolution,&quot; named for his campaign colour and driven by a broad demographic that included strong youth support. He achieved what many observers thought impossible ñ a wonkish, even dorky, academic and visible minority elected to the helm of what is often called Canada's most conservative city after a campaign driven by charisma and sheer determination.<br />
<br />
ìToday Calgary is a different place than it was yesterday. A better place,&quot; Mr. Nenshi said in a speech to his supporters.<br />
<br />
Shortly after 10 p.m. local time, CTV declared him the winner. Global News followed suit an hour later.<br />
<br />
When returns finally showed him in the lead ñ one he would not relinquish ñ a bar where Mr. Nenshi was watching results erupted in a deafening cheer.<br />
<br />
ìThe bar was amazing,&quot; a grinning Mr. Nenshi told The Globe and Mail as he walked into his campaign office. ìIf you have never heard the sound of a city collectively losing its mind, you needed to be in that bar.&quot;<br />
<br />
He said his win ìmeans weíve got a lot of work to do, starting tomorrow [Tuesday],&quot; and that he was ìa little&quot; surprised with how many votes he received.<br />
<br />
ìIt means people heard my message,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
His win also proves that the Internet is a key tool in politics and does indeed deliver support ñ Mr. Nenshi had far more Facebook friends than either of his main competitors, who themselves dismissed that support, saying it wouldn't translate into actual votes.<br />
<br />
But Mr. Nenshi had 39 per cent of the vote with 229 of 241 polls reporting, followed closely by alderman Ric McIver with 32 per cent and former CTV anchor Barb Higgins with 26 per cent. Ms. Higgins raced to an early lead before her numbers collapsed, while Mr. Nenshi started slow and then spiked.<br />
<br />
Mr. McIver, meanwhile, had campaigned essentially since the last election in 2007, preparing to challenge outgoing Mayor Dave Bronconnier, a bitter rival. When Mr. Bronconnier elected not to run, Mr. McIver became the raceís de facto front-runner, with a significant war-chest and plenty of backing among Calgary's conservatives.<br />
<br />
Ms. Higgins entered the race late with little experience but significant name recognition, and tried to position herself as a moderate able to build consensus on city council, which has been bitterly divided for the past three-year term largely because of Mr. Bronconnier and Mr. McIver. Had Ms. Higgins won, she would have been Calgary's first female mayor. However, critics insisted that she didnít have the experience to take the top job, unlike Mr. McIver the alderman and Mr. Nenshi, a veteran observer of city hall.</div></div><hr />
