Recently a Brother from pakistan migrated to Chile with his family for the work daawath after knowing Muslim Arab bloodlines are living in Chile! Many arabs, turks, Indian, russian, javanese Muslims whom migrated to serve the british and others @ last centuries, now they realizes their status of dheen and some learned Kalimah and Al Quran all over the world such continentslike south America, Australia, Russia, Africa, Europe.. . I heard this from the jamaath Member who returned to Sri Lanka, end of the last year. his jamaath Went to China... Once they walking on the street they have found an Old Masjid, entered for their prayers... They are shocked what they have seen inside the masjjid, A dog tied inside and cows are in the Abluation area... There are many photos hanging around wall, there is a family lives inside, they using masjid as their house. Jamaath found one old photo of a Shekih with full beard &amp; turban They wondered and they started asking about him, The house owner replied that was his grandfather and he was the Imam of this Masjid, and he pointed another photo dressed in western , he said that was my dad and he is the past Imam of this Masjid... Now what happend to this masjid why this man using the Masjid as his House, whats wrong with this man? Yes there is a cross and photo of Jesus christ in the Minbar... May Allah forgive our unawareness and sins. Amiin. And this city was a chinese Islamic city before 40 years and now it is completely upside down! Our brothers started their duty giving dawah towards Oneness of Allah and explaining them about Islam and clearing their misconceptions.. With zikr, fiikr and sabr... meanwhile after he realized He Reverted to Islam with his Family. Alhamdulillah and he break the cross, removed all the fotos cleaned the Masjid for Prayers Alhamdulillah they have started calling Azaan in the Masjid after so many years! Takbeer ALLAHU AKBAR.... The Jamaath stayed in the masjid for some days and they did the work of dawah in the village until the people realize there real forgotten faith Islam... Insha Allah we need to do some more efforts to find the people like this and it is every Muslims responsibility of inviting the mankind towards Allah and conveying His message, We have to struggle in the Path Of Allah for the success of Dunya &amp; Akhira... there are more People outside they dont even know to say kalimah but they are holding Islamic names... Please be aware of this matter. Jazakallahu khairan. Hamzah Rahmathullah Weaving Mills Masjid, Colombo, Sri Lanka.<br />
