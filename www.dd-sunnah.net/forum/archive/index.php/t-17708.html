<br />
The term &quot;Wahabism&quot; has been in vogue for over a century and it began to be used in India and spread to the whole of the Muslim world. It is a derogatory and an accusatory term used to denigrate Muslims of certain aqeedah and who shun certain practices, perceived by others to be Islamic. According to users of the term &quot;Wahabism&quot; it refers to Muhammad Ibn Abdulwahhab of Nejd in the Arabian peninsula who lived in the eighteenth century C.E. <br />
<br />
In Muslim culture when a group is attributed or associated with a person it is done for the following commonality:<br />
 1) When people belong to a certain tribe or a place or country or ancestry, such as Ansari, Jaafari, Pakistani, Hindi, Johani, Saudi, Bukhari and so on. <br />
2) When people belong to a certain aqeedah, such as, Ashari, Juhaimi, Sunni, Shi'ah, Khwariji, Zahiri, Batini, and many others. <br />
3) When people belong to a certain Sufi order, such as Chishti, Suhrawardi, Quadri, Naqshbandi, Shadhli, Tijani and so on. <br />
4) When people belong to a certain madhhab or school of thought of fiqh, such as Jaafri, Zaidi, Hanafi, Maliki, Shafe'i, Hanbali, Salafi and so on. <br />
<br />
Let us examine &quot;Wahabism&quot; to find which of the above categories it fits.<br />
<br />
There is no place or tribe or country or nation or family by the name of &quot;Wahab&quot;; it is therefore, not applicable. If we examine to see if Muhammad Ibn Abdulwahhab originated a new aqeedah we find no such thing in his teachings to give credit to him for something new. Did he originate a new Sufi order? We discover that he was neither a sufi nor did he support them. In fact, he fought against certain innovations of the sufis. Did Muhammad Ibn Abdulwahhab presented any new school of fiqhi principles? We find that he was himself an ardent follower of Hanbali madh-hab, and he revered Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal. One of the major contributions of Muhammad Ibn Abdulwahhab is that he discovered and brought into the limelight another great Hanbali scholar, Imam Ibn Taimiyah and his student Ibn Qayyim. We find that Muhammad Ibn Abdulwahhab remained throughout his life a follower of Hanbali madh-hab and did not deviate much from it.<br />
<br />
In the light of what has been said there is no definition of the term &quot;Wahabism&quot; possible except as a label to bring hatred against certain group of people. It is stereotyping, slanderous and a hate-mongering term; no educated person should allow himself to the use of this term. Those who made their goal to fight &quot;Wahabism&quot; are fighting a non-existent enemy, a creation of a figment of their own mind, an imaginary ghost.<br />
<br />
Alleged &quot;Wahabis&quot; do not call any one to follow any new fiqh, any sufi order, any new aqeedah but they call Muslims to follow the Qur'an and Sunnah of the Prophet (S) found in the famous books of Hadith like Bukhari, Muslim, Muwatta, Ibn Majah, Abu Dawud and others. The books of Hadith mentioned are famous and all Sunni Muslims give lip service to them. It is unfortunate that those who call you to go one step beyond lip service to the Qur'an and Sunnah and implement the teachings in your lives are labelled as Wahabis by their opponents.<br />
<br />
Who was Muhammad Ibn Abdulwahhab? He was a reformer and called people to the Qur'an and Sunnah instead of getting trapped into following personality cults of self-appointed, ignorant religious leaders leading masses into the pit of disgrace in this world and the pit of fire in the life hereafter. He did hurt the business of selfish, ignorant and arrogant religious leaders of Arabian Peninsula and he tried to eliminate shirk (associationism with Allah) and bid'ah (innovation in the deen al-Islam). Naturally, those who were hurt by Muhammad's teaching screamed and fought back with their own devilish instruments of slander, lies and hate mongering.<br />
<br />
The Crusaders of Europe wanted to evict Muslims from Jerusalem but could not do so without creating hate hysteria in the European population. Today, in America there are Christian Crusaders of pen and tongue, like Anis Shorrosh, Robert Morey, John Ankerberg and others who are fanning the flames of hatred against Muslims through slander, lies and fabrications about Islam and Muslims. In our age, our enemies have adopted another Christian term to denigrate Muslims, that is, fundamentalism, a term without definition but made derogatory.<br />
<br />
All educated, intelligent and thinking Muslim brethren have a duty to isolate all those who use the term &quot;Wahabism&quot; or &quot;Wahabis&quot; and blindly  associate them with hate mongering groups. We have a duty to love all those who profess to be Muslims and educate those who are ignorant of the true teachings of Islam, rather than creating hate. Those who use the term 'Wahabism or Wahabis&quot; are agents of our enemies, particularly our worst enemy, Shaytan. We have a duty to do all we can to free our brethren from the clutches of Shaytan and his friends.<br />
<br />
In our time, when Islam and Muslims are under attack from all sides, from Christians, Jews, Hindus, atheists, agnostics, secular humanists and secular nationalists, it is not right for us to divide ourselves and fight against each other. We have to pool our resources together and fight the common enemies of Islam and Muslims. If a group among us is different, we should learn to ignore the differences, emphasize the commonality and call each other to the true teachings of the Qur'an and Sunnah of the Messenger (S) of Allah. We should not call any group of people by any name which they do not like, that is slander. There is no group of people who like to be called &quot;Wahabis&quot;, therefore, this term should be dropped by the Muslims. The term &quot;Wahabis&quot; and &quot;Wahabism&quot; was the invention of the British to divide Muslims and fight against each other and weaken each other, so that the British could continue to conquer Muslims land and rule them. We should not allow ourselves to continue to be the victims of Imperialist designs.<br />
Right now you only find the Sufis and shias and other graveworshippers using this term as a form of name calling because, they cant give public lectures saying &quot;The difference between us and &quot;Wahabees&quot; is that they are innovators because they say you cant ask for help from the dead and must seek it only from Allah!&quot; so they resort to name calling and thats it, they cant defend graveworship out loud.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the first half of the twelfth century (Hijra) the Islamic World had reached its extreme decline, degradation and utter fall. The atmosphere was very gloomy and darkness had covered all its regions. Moral degradation and corruption was rampant everywhere. As for religion it was decadent as everything else. The pure and austere monotheism (TAWHEED) of the Prophet (s.a.w.s) had become corrupted with the burgeoning growth of superstition and mysticism. The mosques stood empty, unfrequented and even deserted. The ignorant multitude decked out in amulets, charms and rosaries listened to and blindly followed squalid faqeers and ecstatic dervishes. These men urged them to perform pilgrimages to the tombs of Saints and seek their intercession with Allah. As for the moral precepts ordained by the Qur'√¢n they too were ignored as well as defied. Even the consumption of intoxicants and opium were well nigh universal. In all certainty the life had been bulldozed out of Islam, leaving behind naught but a dry husk of meaningless ritual and degrading superstition.<br />
The period of the Pious Predecessors being already passed, innovations and superstitions cropped up and vastly mushroomed. The people went back to their old practices of idolatry. They started paying homage to shrines and graves, so much so that they even directed their devotional prayers and supplications towards the graves to the exclusion of Allah. They gave precedence to the philosophical views and taqleed (blind following) over the Sunnah. They divested Allah of His essential attributes by making false interpretations on the Qur'√¢nic texts.<br />
But, all praises to Allah, no generation, persistently beset with innovations and abominable Shirk was ever devoid of sincere reformers who revived the faith to its pristine purity. In such darkest hour, a voice came crying out of the vast Arabian desert, the cradle of Islam, calling the faithful back to the true path, the one and only way - the Qur'√¢n and the Sunnah. That was the great Mujaddid and puritan reformer, the celebrated Sheikh Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, who kindled a fire, which spread and engulfed the remotest corners of the Muslim World, purging Islam of its decadence and reviving the fervor of days gone by. The morning of reformation had dawned and the great re-awakening of the Islamic world had begun.<br />
This peaceful, religious, revivalist movement of the Sheikh was obnoxious to the Turks and others for more reasons than one. They tried to crush this movement by force. They even killed some of the leaders, but could not destroy the movement outright. The movement lived on and is now growing all over the world. Everywhere in the Muslim world we are witnessing, the raising of the banner of Tawheed and the revival of the Call to the Qur'√¢n and Sunnah.<br />
All around the Muslim world, we see some Muslims, individually and collectively proclaiming the Call to Tawheed and the return to the Qur'√¢n and Sunnah in the face of opposition by the ‚ÄòSaint-worshippers‚Äô, `Grave-worshippers`, `the Sufis‚Äô and the ‚ÄòTariqat followers‚Äô. These deviant groups all purport or make the false claim to be Ahl us Sunnah wal Jam‚Äôaah and label the true callers to The Sunnah as `Wahhabis‚Äô<br />
In view of the ignoble and false propaganda mounted against the reformatory movement of Sheikh Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab and the derogatory use of the word `Wahhabi‚Äô for the movement ant its followers, we will Insha Allah in the course of this booklet, give a short account of the important events of his life and salient features of his creed and of his works.<br />
<br />
HIS LIFE STORY<br />
Sheikh Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab ibn Sulaiman ibn Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Rashid al Tamimi was born in the year 1155 A.H.(1703 C.E.) in ‚ÄòAyina to the north of Riyadh, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the reign of Abdulla ibn Muhammad ibn Hamd ibn Muammar. He excelled over his contemporaries in intelligence and physique and was able to commit the Qur'√¢n to memory by the time he was ten years old. His father found him capable of leading the congregational prayers and decided to get him married that year.<br />
He studied the Hanbali Jurisprudence, Tafsir and Hadith from his learned father. During his childhood itself, he directed his full attention to the books on Tafsir, Hadith and Aqidah and particularly to the writings of Sheik al Islam Ibn Taimiya and Ibn al Qayyim and made a deep study of them.<br />
He left his native town to perform the Hajj and then proceeded to Madinah. At that time Sheikh Abdullah bin Ibrahim ibn Saif belonging to the progeny of Saif Najdi was chief of the scholars of Madinah. Sheikh Muhammad acquired a good deal of knowledge from him and came to be loved and held in high esteem by his teacher. His strong stand on Thawheed and his deep concern over false beliefs and evil deeds brought about a strong bond between the Sheikh and his teacher. He was so impressed by his student that Sheikh Abdullah granted him permission of narrating well-known hadiths of two of the authorities. Firstly on the authority of Ibn Muflih reporting from Sheikh Ibn Taiymiyyah and reaching up to Imam Ahmad. Secondly on the authority of Abd al Rahman bin Rajab, reporting from Ibn al Qayyim who narrated it from his teacher Sheikh ibn Taiymiyya reaching up to Imam Ahmad. Sheikh Abdullah also authorized him to narrate all the traditions reported by Sheikh Abd al Baqi Hanbali, the chief among the great teachers of his time. He also authorised him to narrate the traditions of the Sahih of Bukhari and the traditions of the Sahih of Muslim and commentaries of both, the Sunan of Tirmidhi, Nasa‚Äôai, Abu Dawud, Ibn Maajah, the Muwatta of Imam Malik and the Musnad of Imam Ahmad.<br />
During this time he came to know and benefited from the knowledge of other scholars such as Ali Afendi Daghastanee, Ismaeel Ajluni and others. Then he moved on to Nejd, Basra and Syria for the purpose of acquiring further knowledge. He stayed for a long time in Basra, where he pursued his studies under a number of renowned scholars, among whom Sheikh Muhammad Majmui was most prominent. During this time he compiled and published many valuable books on the topic of innovations, superstitions and the supplication to the dead ones in the graves. He supported his treatises with manifest evidence from the Qur'√¢n.<br />
The adherents of falsehood defamed, tortured and turned him out of Basra. They also persecuted his teacher Sheikh Majmui. He left for the town of Zubair in the scorching heat of the summer and was almost dying of thirst, when Allah sent to him a man called Abu Hamidan. He found the Sheikh to be a man of learning and righteousness. So he mounted him on his animal and took him to Zubair. Sheikh Muhammad thought of going to Syria to quench his thirst for more knowledge, but soon fell short of provision and was compelled to return to Nejd. He arrived at Ahsa and stayed with the Sheikh Abdullah ibn Abd al Latiff Shafi‚Äôi and studied under him.<br />
<br />
UN-ISLAMIC PRACTICES OF THAT TIME.<br />
Sheikh Muhammad then went to Harimala, a village of Nejd because his father had transferred there and stayed with him. He devoted himself fully to the learning of Tafsir and Hadith, particularly the works of Skeikh ibn Taiymiyyah and Sheikh ibn Qayyim. This immensely increased his knowledge and insight and infused in his heart a spirit of determination and steadfastness. With his deep insight he could visualize all the un-Islamic notions and corrupt practices prevailing in Nejd and the countries he had visited. Even in Madinah, he saw people invoking the Prophet (sal) and making supplication to him. He decided to disseminate the True message of Islam throughout the Arabian Peninsula.<br />
The Sheikh found that Nejd was infested with corrupt beliefs and religious practices repugnant to the fundamentals of the True Religion. There were a number of graves in the Nejd area which were attributed to some of the Companions of the Prophet (sal). People visited these graves and invoked them for help in their hour of need. In Jubila they visited the grave of Zaid ibn Khattab and seeking relief for their needs. In Manfuha, people sought mediatiothrouga male palm-tree believing that a spinster, who pays a visit to it, soon gets married.<br />
In Dariya there was a cave which people frequented. Similarly there was grave of Dirar ibn al Azwar in the valley of Ghabira. It was the same story as in Basra and Zubair where people worship idols of the pre-Islamic period. A similar sad state of affairs prevailed in Iraq, Syria Egypt and Yemen.<br />
He compared all these practices in the light of the Qur'√¢n and the practices of the Prophet (sal) and his Companions and found them far removed from and inconsistent with the religion and spirit of Islam. This was the sorry state of affairs not only with the people of Nejd but of other places as well, in the Muslim world.<br />
<br />
CALL FOR REVIVAL OF PURE MONOTHEISM<br />
The Sheikh found that the people had abandoned their faith, and the more he studied their deviations, the firmer he grew in his conviction and determination that Muslims should inevitably change themselves and tread the path of the Pious Predecessors. The hadiths of Prophet (Sal) say as follows:<br />
1. `You must necessarily tread the path of those who lived before you‚Äô.<br />
2. `The last hour shall not come, until some of the people of my Ummah begin to worship idols.‚Äô<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3. `Islam was born a stranger and shall return as a stranger in similar manner.‚Äô<br />
<br />
Sheikh Muhammad had by now resolved to publicly declare unto his people that they had gone astray from the right path.<br />
He started with his call to the people in the town of Harimala, and made it clear to them, that he called them only unto Allah. He reminded the people that everything should be for Allah alone and that they should give up their wrong beliefs and practices. This naturally led to a dispute and struggle with the people and even with his father, who had been led away by the false sayings of the deviated followers.<br />
The Sheikh continued to pursue his cause undeterred by making speeches, writing as well as practically guiding the people. Eventually a good majority of his people accepted his views. His father and brother Sulaiman too were convinced after prolonged discussions. In the year 1153 A.H. his father Abd al Wahhab passed away.<br />
After the death of his father the people openly accepted the call of the Sheikh and forsook their false notions. They responded to the call for a return to the Sunnah of the Prophet (sal) both in words and deeds.<br />
During this time his town was dominated by two tribes both claiming leadership but none able to take full control and maintain justice. These tribes were in the practice of keeping slaves and indulged in every mischief and sin. When the Sheikh thought of admonishing them, they got wind of it and set upon him but were prevented by the timely action of some good people.<br />
The Sheikh left Harimala for his native town Aiyna, where his forefathers once lived and ruled. Here he met one Uthman bin Hamd bin Muammar, to whom he explained his reformist movement based on the Quran and Sunnah. He explained the significance of Thawheed and how much the beliefs and actions of the people differed from the true path. He told Uthman that if he would uphold the cause of Allah and his word, he would soon come to the leadership in Nejd and crowned with eternal bliss.<br />
Uthman responded readily to the Sheikh‚Äôs call. Here again the Sheikh urged the people to return to the worship of Allah only (Thawheed) and a strict adherence to the Sunnah of the Prophet (sal). The Sheikh managed to cut down trees that were being worshipped in the area. He succeeded with the help of Uthman, in bringing down the dome over the grave of Zaid ibn al Khattab. He also carried out the prescribed punishment for adultery on a woman who had confessed to it.<br />
The Sheikh and his message came to be widely known, and his reputation spread far and wide and it also reached Sulaiman bin Muhammad bin Urai‚Äôir, the Governor of Ahsa and the children of Khalid. This impudent and ignorant man sent a letter to Uthman bin Muammir saying, ‚Äúthis man who is with you is saying this and did that, and when you receive this letter slay him, if not we shall withhold your kharaj (revenue} which is with us in Ahsa.‚Äù This was a tricky situation for Uthman. To oppose Urair was too much for him. Fearing this threat and weak in his faith ibn Muammar ordered the Sheikh to be banished from his town.<br />
The Sheikh left the town on foot escorted by a horseman through the desert in the scorching sun, with only the thought of Allah, until he reached Dariya as the guest of Abd al rahman bin Suwailim. Through ibn Suwailim most of the prominent people of Dariya came to know of the Sheikh. They visited him in secret and he explained to them the real meaning and the significance of Thawheed. Among those who visited the Sheikh were the two brothers of Prince Muhammad bin Saud. These two brothers after much discussion and tutoring by the Sheikh were enlightened. They explained to their brother prince Muhammad that Sheikh Muhammad was staying with Ibn Suwailim and that he was a blessing from Allah sent to them. They urged the prince to meet the Sheikh.<br />
<br />
PRINCE MUHAMMED BIN SAUD ACCEPTS THE SHEIKH<br />
Prince Muhammad accepted the suggestion and met the Sheikh. He invited the Prince to Thawheed saying that it was the message, with which all the Messengers were sent by Allah. He also drew the attention of the Prince to the polytheistic practices and notions prevalent among the people of the Nejd. He wished that the Prince should assume leadership of the Muslims. The prince acceded to the wish of the Sheikh and offered him all help and assistance to carry out his task. He also promised to adhere to the Sunnah of the Prophet (sal) to command the good and to prohibit the evil.<br />
After the Sheikh had settled at Dariya, people began to throng to him from all sides even claiming kinship and accepting his Call. In the meantime Uthman ibn Muammar who exiled the Sheikh from his town came to know of Prince Muhammad‚Äôs acceptance of Sheikh Muhammad and his message. Now Uthman very much regretted what he had done to the Sheikh.<br />
Uthman ibn Muammar, accompanied by a large delegation came to Dariya and called on the Sheikh to tender their apologies. They requested the Sheikh to come back with them. He replied that it depended entirely on the wish of Prince Muhammad. Prince Muhammad refused to accede to their request and Uthman and his followers went back disappointed.<br />
<br />
SHEIKH GAINS A FOLLOWING<br />
Now people came in large numbers to the Sheikh, seeking pure knowledge without the adulteration of fables and falsehood. He explained to them the real meaning of ‚ÄúLa ilaaha illallah‚Äù and its significance. He stressed the importance of the negation of all false deities and the affirmation of Allah and his attributes.<br />
The Sheikh communicated with people of other cities and invited them to accept his call and join his movement in order to eradicate Shirk and all its abominable practices.<br />
Some accepted while others rejected and some even ridiculed him and accused him of sorcery. He continued with his mission undeterred. The opponents exerted their utmost to rally their forces to destroy this nascent movement by any or all means. Sheikh Muhammad and the Prince had no alternative but to resort to the sword to defend this movement. This war went on for many years and village after village fell to the new alliance. Some opponents voluntarily began to accept them when they realized the true nature of the movement.<br />
All the efforts by the misguided group to rally their forces to destroy this nascent movement by any means miserably failed. After the conquest of Riyadh in 1187 A.H. the Sheikh entrusted the governing of the people to Prince Abdul Aziz bin Muhammad bin Saud and devoted his time to worship, learning and teaching. Prince Muhammad and his son Abd al Aziz always consulted him before they undertook anything and he gave his ruling. After an arduous struggle and having reached his goal he passed away in Dhul Qa‚Äôdah of 1206.<br />
<br />
BOOKS WRITTEN BY SHEIKH MUHAMMAD<br />
The Sheikh was the author of a number of books, prominent among them being the celebrated KITAB AL TAWHID, which needs no introduction. The other books are Kash al Shubuhat, Thalabat al Usul, theMukhtasar al-Sal-Nabawiyyah, the Mukhthasar al-Insaaf, the Sharh al-Kabir fi‚Äôl Fiqh, the Nasihat al-Muslimin bi-ahadite Khatam al-Nabiyyin, the Kitab al-Kabair, the Ahadith al-Fitn and several other treatises and most of them were pertaining to the topic of Tawheed.<br />
It is mentioned in the work Unwan al-Majid that the Sheikh had many pupils amongst whom were his sons who later became eminent scholars. His four sons Hussain, Abdullah, Ali and Ibrahim established schools close to their homes and taught the young students from Dariya and other places. The fifth son had not studied under him and had died in his youth.<br />
Some for the students who benefited from his knowledge and rose to the position of Qadis and Muftis are as follows:<br />
Sheikh Abd al Aziz bin Abdullah al Hussein al Nasim who was a Judge in the territory of Al Washm.<br />
Sheikh Said bin Hijji who became Judge of Hauta of Bani Tamim,<br />
Sheikh abd al Rahman bin Nami, who became Judge of Aiyna<br />
Ahsa, Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashid al-Uraini the Qadi of Sudair.<br />
The most notable student was Sheikh Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Abdul Latiff bin Abdul Rahman bin Hassan who was the grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia.<br />
A SUMMARY OF THE STRUGGLE OF SHEIKH MUHAMMED<br />
Due to the Sheikh‚Äôs strong views on Tawhid he was a controversial figure throughout his life and after his death to this day. We will reproduce here some of his communications and excerpts of treatises he had written for the benefit of the readers. Here is what he wrote to al-Suwaidi one of the scholars of Iraq in reply to his letter:‚ÄúFrom Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab to his brother in faith Abd al-Rahman ibn Abdalla- Peace be upon you and also the Mercy and the Blessings of Allah. To continue: I am pleased to receive your letter. May Allah make you one of the leaders of the pious people and also one of the missionaries calling people to the Religion of the Chief of the Messengers. I would like to inform you that I am by the Grace of Allah a follower of the Pure Religion and not a Mubtadi(Innovator). My Creed and Religion with which I obey Allah is the same Madhab as that of the Ahl al-Sunnah wal Jama‚Äôah and as that held by the leaders of the Muslims such as the four celebrated leaders of law and their followers till the day of resurrection.However, I have laid emphasis on faithfulness and sincerity in following the Religion of Allah. I have asked the people not to invoke the living and the dead from among the saintly and pious people seeking help. I have also advised them to avoid committing acts of SHIRK (associating other objects in the worship of Allah) while offering devotion to Allah in such matters like slaughtering for sacrifice, making vows, trusting in anyone or in Sujood (Prostration) and such other matters which are exclusively reserved for Allah alone. None is to be taken as a partner unto Allah may he be an angel or a prophet commissioned by him. It is he alone that all the messengers from the first to the last were ordered to obey and worship. This is the Madhab followed by the Ahl al Sunnah wal Jama‚Äôah.I have also told the people in clear words that the first and the earliest of people who introduced acts of SHIRK were the Rafidah (Shia extremists) who invoked Ali and others, seeking help for their needs and to rid them of their afflictions.I hold an office in my town where people listen to me and obey me. This was disliked by some of the chief magnates of the town as what I said was against their traditions. I lead the people in the stipulated prayers and induce them to pay their Zakat and to perform other acts of devotion to Allah. I forbade them to indulge in RIBA, in drinking wine and all other intoxicants. The people opposed these corrupt leaders and rose against them. This is the Thawheed I have been commanded to preach. These mischievous magnates of the town began to ascribe different kinds of fabrications to me. The mischief flared up and they attacked us with all the armies of Satan, the cavalry and the infantry. They allege that I branded all the people as `Kaafirs‚Äô except those who follow me and that I have solemnized their marriages in a wrong and illegal manner. I wonder how a sane man can think of and say such silly things. I however, declare myself free from such calumnies in the presence of Allah. Such talks can only emanate from the mentally deranged. In short whatsoever is mentioned about me- except that I invite them to Thawheed and prohibit them from committing acts of Shirk, is absolutely false.‚Äù<br />
<br />
MATTERS TO WHICH THE SHEIKH INVITED THE PUBLIC AND WHICH GOT HIM INTO DISPUTE WITH SOME OF THE ULEMAS:<br />
<br />
1.Tawhid al-Ubudiya<br />
He explained to the people that Ibadah is nothing but exclusive obedience to Allah and compliance with His commands. This is a comprehensive term for everything that Allah loves and such words and deeds He is pleased with. The forms of Ibadah (Worship) which are to be offered to Allah alone are many, such as Salat (Prayers), Saum (Fasting), Zakat and Sadaqah, slaughtering of sacrificial animals, tawaf and invocation. He said that anyone who happens to direct any of these acts to anyone other than Allah becomes a Mushriq as Allah the Exalted says:‚Äú And whoever invokes (or worships) besides Allah any other ilah (god) of whom he has no proof, then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely Al-Kafirun (the disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah polytheists, pagans idolaters etc.) will not be successful.‚Äù Al Quran 23:117<br />
<br />
2. Tawassul<br />
This means a fervent plea and is of two types: the permitted and the prohibited. The permitted one is by means of faith and righteous deeds and the Glorious Names of Allah and his attributes. The prohibited one is entreaty using the name of the Messenger, pious people and saints. Here is what Allah the Exalted says:‚ÄúO you who believe! Be mindful of your duty towards Allah and seek the means of approach and strive in His cause as much as you can so that you may be successful.‚Äù Al Quran5:35<br />
<br />
3. Journeying to Mosques on Pilgrimage<br />
He asked the people not to undertake any pilgrimages to mosques other then the three mosques as given in an authentic hadith.‚ÄúDo not undertake a journey but to the three mosques - the Sacred Mosque Makkah) my mosque (Madinah) and the further Mosque (Al Aqsa).‚Äù<br />
<br />
4. Construction over graves, covering and decorating them etc.<br />
The Sheikh openly declared that to construct buildings over the graves is unlawful. So is to shroud the graves with beautiful coverings and decorating them. It is prohibited to burn candles over the graves or to set up stone in************************ions. He also declared that it is illegal to have custodians and caretakers of shrines. Visiting such places tantamount to idol worship and can lead to other prohibited actions such as kissing them and going round them. He supported his statements with numerous hadiths prohibiting such constructions, visiting them and praying in them. The Shaikh quoted the hadith of Abu ‚Äòl-Hayyaj al-Asadi whom Ali ibn Abi Talib asked:‚ÄúShould I not commission you with a duty with which the Messenger of Allah had commissioned me-to leave no statue but to crush it, and no grave raised above the surface of the ground but to level it down?‚Äù<br />
<br />
5. Unity with respect of the Holy Names and Attributes of Allah<br />
On this the Sheikh held the views of the Pious Predecessors and the four celebrated teachers of law and others who held the same view, namely the affirmation and recognition of the Names and Attributes of Allah without employing Tamtheel (finding similarity with Allah‚Äôs attributes) or Takeef. (e.g. To explain how Allah does some thing).<br />
<br />
6. Innovations<br />
The Sheikh very much disliked and spoke out against innovations (Bida‚Äô) especially:1. The celebration and holding of gatherings on the Prophet‚Äôs Birthday.2. Making Dhikr and salawath before pronouncing the Adhan.3. Verbally pronouncing the Niyyah (intention) particularly before Takbir Tahrim.4. Recital of a hadith of Abu Huraira before the Khatib ascends the Minbar. (Pulpit)The Sheikh also abhorred and condemned the innovated practices of Tariqas (Orders), Tawassuf (Mysticism) and other practices which have no authority or sanction eitfrom the Messenger (sal) or from the Companion(R.A). Several Ulema had compiled works on this subject even before Sheikh Muhammad such as Ibn-Waddah, al-Turthushi and al-Shatibi on these abominable innovated practices and heretical actions.This is a short biography of the best of reformers and the greatest of Mujahids and a renowned scholar of Islam, whom Allah blessed with deep insight. This reform movement was initiated by Sheikh Muhammad and not by Sheikh Abdul Wahhab. The correct name for this movement should have been ‚Äúal-Muhammadiya‚Äù and not ‚Äúal Wahhabiya‚Äù. In the light of the above facts it is left to the reader to judge whether the Sheikh initiated a new madhab or was reviving the deen of the Prophet (sal), his noble companions and their successors.Indeed all Praise and thanks be to Allah the Exalted, who has graced us with the favor of preparing this life sketch of the Sheikh Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. May Allah be merciful to him and Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon Muhammad (sal) upon his family, all his noble companions and their successors until the last day.</div></div><hr />

Sheikh Muhammad Bin Abdul Wahhab<br />
by Shaykh Suhayb Hasan 'Abdul Ghaffaar<br />
<br />
Prologue <br />
All Praise belongs to Allah Almighty, Creator of the worlds. Peace and salutations be upon the Prophet Muhammad, his family and all his Companions.<br />
The revivalist movement begun by Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab (1115AH - 1206AH / 1703AD - 1792AD) in the Arabian Peninsula was destined to take root and become widely accepted. It sowed the seeds for a wise leadership which pledged upon itself the implementation of Islamic Sharee'ah in its totality, using the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah to enlighten all its activities. It was honoured with victory and success from Allaah, the Almighty, and so has remained a potent force since its inception two centuries ago, despite severely hostile attacks on both religious and political levels. The movement exceeded the boundaries of the Arabian Peninsula and bore fruit in a number of other countries in the hands of many sincere scholars and propagators of Islaam who were inspired by its teachings and guided by its example. It was a blessed movement, like a good tree, the root of which is firm, and the branches of which stand tall in the sky.<br />
But like any reformatory movement, it too faced an onslaught of arrows, thrown both at the founder of the movement and at his beliefs and teachings. For a start, it was given the derogatory title of Wahhabism which, although unacceptable to its founder and followers, was nevertheless widely accepted and adopted. Worse still, the State was subjected to strong criticisms and dreadful slanders in the most vulgar language, which exposed the measure of animosity felt by its opponents. Such critical writings had a great appeal among those fond of innovations and superstitions, but a host of knowledgeable people from various Muslim countries stood up to refute each and every allegation, using convincing proofs and evidences, and fragmenting all the attacks into particles of scattered dust. As most of these writings, whether positive or hostile, are extant in Arabic works, it was felt that there was no need to repeat them here. So the author of this paper searched for other writings on the subject in English or Urdu, and chose a few of them to mention in this paper. He has endeavoured to refute all the doubts which were raised in the books in question in the light of the writings of Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab and all the scholars who defended him at home and abroad.. <br />
In the confines of this paper it was not possible to cover all the different ramifications of this extensive subject, so the author hopes that readers will accept his apologies for any shortcomings (unintentional as they are) and will pray for him for Allaah's guidance and rewards if they benefit from this humble effort.<br />
Indeed Allaah is the One Who Guides to the Right Way.. <br />
Margoliouth<br />
We begin this discussion with writings from the Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics. This work is considered to be among the oldest and most exhaustive reference works to discuss religion in the English language.<br />
William Margoliouth, author of the chapter on 'Wahhabism', writes that Wahhabis differ from Ahl us Sunnah wal Jama'ah in ten areas:<br />
They attribute to Allaah physical characteristics such as a Face and Hands<br />
Reasoning has no place in religious questions, which must be settled solely on tradition<br />
Consensus is rejected<br />
Analogy is rejected<br />
The Imaam's of Madhahib have no authority and those who follow them are not Muslims<br />
Those who do not join them (the 'Wahhabis' are also not Muslims<br />
Neither the Prophet (SAS) nor a saint will be allowed to intercede<br />
Visiting the graves is prohibited<br />
To take an oath in the name of other than Allaah (SWT) is prohibited<br />
To offer an vow for other than Allah (SWT) and to slaughter besides the graves in the names of the saints are not allowed<br />
However he acknowledges that there is a doubt concerning the authenticity of point no.5 which has been attributed to Wahhabism, as they are the followers of Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal, himself one of the four Imams. Margoliouth ends his article with the observation that Imaam Ahmad ash Shaheed (d. 1831) introduced Wahhabism to India following a pilgrimage to Makkah in 1824 [1] . What is strange is that an eminent Orientalist like W. Margoliouth finds plenty of quotations from the opponents of Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab, yet nothing to defend him except for point no. 5.<br />
So let us remedy this by discussing the list and including our refutation where necessary.<br />
Refutation of Each Point :<br />
1- The belief of Sheikh Ibn Al Wahhab regarding the Attributes of Allaah is the same belief of the Salaf, our pious predecessors. They said that Allaah Almighty has all the attributes which He has declared for Himself. These include Attributes related to his own self, such as the Face, Hands and Eye, and Attributes of action, such as His Pleasure, Anger, Being on. the Throne and Descending from it. They accept all such de************************ions without Takyeeef (asking how they happen), Ta'teel (negating them altogether) or Tashbeeh (anthropomorphic analogy). The basis of this belief is the statement of Allaah, 'Nothing is similar unto Him, and He Listens and Sees.' [2] Just as Allaah's Attributes do not resemble in any way the attributes of human beings, so His Being does not resemble the being of humans.<br />
2- The criticism that the followers of Sheikh Muhammad ibn al Wahhab have no regard for intellectual reasoning is a total fabrication. What we do say is that reason cannot be independent of revelation. If we take the analogy of the eye and light, we know that the eye needs light to function. This can be natural light from the sun, moon or stars, or artificial light. In the same way, the human intellect is enlightened by and functions within divine revelation, which makes it trustworthy. If it lacks divine revelation, it will go astray in the darkness of ignorance. Human intellect varies and differs; the reasoning of a thinker will be different from the reasoning of a philosopher; the reasoning of a historian will be different from the reasoning of a mathematician.<br />
3- They have claimed that the Wahhabis rejected the concept of Ijma' Consensus. This too is untrue. Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal considered the true Ijma' to be that of the Companions. The time of the Companions is a specific period, known for its beginning and end. The Companions witnessed revelation and accepted the message of the Messenger of Allaah at first-hand.<br />
Imaam Muhammad Abu Zahra said in this issue that Ijma' is of two types: Ijma' on the basic obligatory actions, which is recognised by all. And Ijma' on other rulings of Sharee'ah, such as fighting apostates. A difference of opinion regarding the second type has been attributed to Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal. Some scholars have reported the following from him: 'Any person who claims the existence of Ijma' is a liar.' <br />
Imaam Ibn al Qayyim has said, 'The person who claims Ijma' has lied,' and he did not like giving preference to Ijma' over an authentic Hadith.. <br />
Abdullah, son of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, said, 'I heard my father say, 'Whenever a man claims al Ijma', he is a liar. It may have been the case that difference of opinion occurred among the people, but he did not know about it. At the most he should say: We do not know anyone who opposed.' <br />
This statement shows that Imaam Ahmad did not deny the principle of Ijma', but denied knowledge of its occurrence after the period of the Sahabah. [3] <br />
4- It is also claimed that Sheikh Muhammad ibn al Wahhab denied Qiyas (analogy). This is incorrect as the Sheikh held the same opinion about this subject as the Hanbali School in general. Imaam Abu Zahra said, 'It is reported from Ahmad that one cannot be free of Qiyas as it was adopted by the Sahabah.' <br />
Once Imaam Ahmad had established this principle, the Hanbali school accepted it widely. Qiyas was used whenever a new situation arose for which they could not find a reference from the Hadeeth or sayings of the Sahabah. [4]<br />
5- The allegation that leaders of other mazahib have no authority and their followers are not Muslims, and that'<br />
6- 'anyone who does not join the Wahhabi movement is a Kafir.<br />
<br />
Both the above allegations are clear fabrications. Sheikh Abdullah, son of Sheikh Muhammad ibn al Wahhab, wrote a treatise after he entered Makkah victoriously with Prince Saud bin Abdul Aziz on Saturday 8th Muharram 1218 AH. In this he wrote, 'Our mazhab in the principle of the Deen is the Deen of Ahl ul Sunnah wal Jama'ah. Our way is the way of the Salaf, the pious predecessors. Our branch of mazhab is that of Ahmad bin Hanbal, but we do not reject anyone who follows any of the four Imaams excluding other mazahib which are not fully regulated.'<br />
He continues, <br />
'Those people who invent lies against us to conceal the truth and deceive the people; they make the people believe we degrade the status of the Prophet (SAWS), we teach he has no intercession and visiting him is not recommended; we do not depend on the sayings of the ulama, we declare the people in general to be kafirs, we stop people sending salutations on the Messenger of Allaah (SAWS), and we. do not recognise the rights of Ahl ul Bayt ' to all these allegations our answer is, 'May Allaah be glorified, this is indeed a great lie.'<br />
Therefore anyone who attributes any of these beliefs to us has attributed a lie. [5] <br />
7-The claim that Sheikh ibn al Wahhab believed there is no intercession on the part of a prophet or saint. Our reply is that the author of the article was obviously ignorant of the difference between two types of Shafa'a (intercession). The first contains Shirk, and this was rejected by Sheikh ibn al Wahhab. The second which was approved by him, is the Intercession performed only with permission from Allaah on the Day of Judgement, by a being chosen by Allaah for this honour [6] . If the critics of Wahhabism mean by this that the Sheikh has forbidden Al Waseelah through prophets and saints, our reply is that most people do not understand the opinions of both Sheikh ibn al Wahhab and Imaam ibn Hanbal on this issue and have levelled false charges against them. Imaam ibn Taymiyyah said that Imaam Ahmad has been reported in the 'Rituals of Al Marwazi' as to how to achieve Waseelah of the Prophet (SAWS) through his du'a. But there are others who did not approve of it. Tawassul achieved through faith in the Prophet (SAWS), through love for him, through following him and through obeying him is acceptable to both parties. But Tawassul through the person of the Prophet (SAWS) is a ****************************ious issue, and wherever a dispute arises, it should be referred back to Allaah and His Messenger. [7]<br />
8- The claim that Wahhabis declare the visiting of the graves and tombs to be haram will be discussed later, alongside the writings of Ignaz Goldziher.<br />
9- They claim that Wahhabis declare haram the taking of oaths with anyone other than Allaah. This is indeed true as it is proven by authentic hadeeth. Umar bin al Khattab narrated that the Prophet (SAWS) said, 'Anyone who swears by any other than Allaah has committed Shirk.'<br />
<br />
This is reported by At Tirmidhi who declared it as hadeeth hasan. It was also declared Sahih by Al Hakim.<br />
Ibn Mas'ud said, 'It is preferable to me to swear by Allaah when lying than to swear by other than Allaah when speaking the truth.' [8] <br />
10- It is also claimed that Sheikh ibn al Wahhab believes that vows in the name of others than Allaah is haram, and that meat slaughtered besides graves in the name of saints is also haram. This is perfectly true, as it is from the Deen of Allaah, and every Muslim should believe it as long as he believes in Allaah and His Messenger. In his great book 'Kitab al Tawhid', Sheikh ibn al Wahhab includes a chapter under the title, 'No slaughtering should be offered for Allaah in a place where slaughtering is offered for beings other than Allaah.' His next chapter title is, 'To vow in the name of someone other than Allaah is Shirk.' Both chapters contain extensive proofs from the Qur'an and Sunnah to support these statements.<br />
Goldziher<br />
We now come to the writings of the German Orientalist Ignaz Goldziher in 'Muslim Studies'. This appeared in two volumes in German in 1889 and was translated into English in 1967. The author devoted a long chapter of 96 pages to the subject of 'Veneration of Saints in Islam'. He discusses at great length the excessive attribution of miracles to saints whether living or dead, by Muslims. He also gives a wealth of examples of sanctifying graves and tombs from Islamic literature and general Muslim practice. His aim is to show that there is no difference between Christians and Muslims in the veneration of saints. Pointing to Qur'‚nic verses and Hadeeth which refute such practices, he comments, <br />
'After all this there is no need to explain in detail that within Islam in its original form there was no room for the veneration of saints as it so largely developed later. The Koran itself polemizes directly against the veneration of saints in other confessions which consider their ahbar and ruhban as arbab, divine masters (Sura 9:31)'<br />
He then quotes Karl Hase regarding the saint cult and says, <br />
'That it 'satisfies within a monotheistic religion a polytheistic need to fill the enormous gap between men and their god',' [9]<br />
After the author has included numerous examples of veneration of saints by the general Muslim public and the visiting of graves and tombs for praying for one's needs, he also gives examples of scholars who objected to such forms of Shirk. He quotes the impenetrable stance of Imam ibn Taymiyyah in the issue of Tawassul and journeying to places other than the three Mosques. He then says, <br />
'This shows that Wahhabism had its forerunners and that it only expressed in a corporate way what was also earlier the inner conviction of old traditional Muslims. From this point of view it would be of great interest for the cultural and religious history of Islam to collect all pre-Wahhabi manifestations of a monotheistic reaction in Islam against pagan survivals which it inherited from paganism or which infiltrated from outside, and to relate these manifestations to the surroundings which gave them rise. Apart from the older manifestations just mentioned it would be possible to list one which can probably be counted the latest: the scene which took place six decades before the beginning of the Wahhabite movement in 1711 in the Mu'ayyad mosque at Cairo. One evening in Ramadan the catechism of Birgewi was being interpreted when a youth ' he is called a Rumi ë ascended the pulpit and preached passionately against the ever increasing cult of saints and graves, branding this degenerate form of Islamic worship as idolatory. He said, ëWho has seen the hidden tablet of fateí Not even the prophet himself. All these graves of saints must be destroyed, those who kiss the coffins are infidels, the convents of the Mewlewi and Bektashi must be demolished, the dervishes should study rather than dance.í The zealous youth, who interpreted the fatwa issued against him in a derisive manner and who repeated his provocative speeches for several evenings, disappeared mysteriously from Cairo. The ëulamaí do not cease to decorate the graves of their saints and to confirm the people in their disbelief in this complete nonsense.í [10] <br />
The objective behind recording the above quotations is to show that this German author is enough proof to vindicate the Wahhabi stance against visiting tombs and supplicating to the dead, as the religion of Islaam has never allowed such practices. A brief glimpse of Sheikh ibn al Wahhabís book ëIssues of pre-Islamic eraí is enough to show the Messenger of Allaah (SAWS) opposed the practices of Jahiliyyah. The book contains some interesting chapters: <br />
To take graves of past people as places of worship<br />
To take impressions/remains of the Prophet (SAWS) as Mosques<br />
To light lamps on graves<br />
To declare graves as Eid<br />
Offering sacrifices besides graves<br />
To take blessings from people who were held sacred<br />
In these chapters he shows through ahaadeeth that the people of Jahiliyyah took these matters from the Ahl ul Kitab: the Jews and Christians. Islaam came to destroy all such practices, but they were re-introduced among the Muslim masses, so there was a need to purify Islaam from such practices anew. <br />
Here, let us quote a very clear reply by Sultan Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman Al-Saud to the deputation which came from India in 1924, asking him to reconstruct the tombs on the graves. He said to them, ëWe are concerned with the renovation of the sacred places and to keep them in a dignified and respectable manner. As for reconstructing them, we can only act in accordance with the Islamic Sharee'ah. It is our duty to implement the rulings of the Sharee'ah in the sacred places as reported by the pious ancestors and the four Imaams. I am ready to rebuild them with gold and silver if the scholars of the Ummah agree to say that building them is an obligation.í [11]<br />
However, Goldziher attributes the sanctity of the Black Stone among the Muslims to a remnant of idolatory. We refute this by simply quoting Syyedina Umar bin al Khattab, who said when kissing it, ëI know that you are a stone which does not benefit nor harm. But had I not seen the Messenger of Allaah kissing you, I would not have kissed you.í [12] <br />
Similarly, Goldziherís remarks about bidía are not just: ëThe exaggerated, fanatical attitude to the Sunnah, even in quite trivial matters, is matched by a similar fanaticism towards bidía. Modern Wahhabism follows the pattern of earlier times in striving to brand as bidía not only anything contrary to the spirit of the Sunnah but also everything that cannot be proved to be in it. It is known that the ultra-conservative opposed every novelty, the use of coffee and tobacco, as well as printing, coming under this heading. Muslim theologians even today are not entirely reconciled to the use of knife and fork.í [13] <br />
It is an established fact that declaring something to be bidía is not dependent upon the moods of people but on established principles. The Prophet (SAWS) said, ëAnyone who innovates in this matter of ours something which is not from it will have it rejected.í [14]<br />
<br />
He also said, ëThe one who practices something not in accordance with our matter will have it rejected.í [15] <br />
So the whole issue is related to the worldly matters and not the religious ones. It is moreover regulated with a number of conditions which make it quite difficult to label something Bidía easily, contrary to what the German orientalist claimed and falsely attributed to Wahhabism. <br />
Arberry<br />
Religions in the Middle East: A. J. Arberry <br />
Arberryís comments on the history of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and on the movement begun by Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab are generally acceptable. However, his final thoughts on Wahhabism need to be discussed. He says, ëHow far can Wahhabism go along the path of adjustment without losing its essential characterí Much depends on the quality of leadership and much also depends on the generality of Wahhabis. Borrowing and adaptation from various sources both Eastern and Western, will go on but if the Wahhabis can hold fast to their fundamental beliefs, they stand a good chance of preserving the State which their predecessors in the faith laboured to build.í [16 ]<br />
Arberry also discusses the issue of whether Syyed Ahmad Ash Shaheed (1786-1831) had been favourably impressed by Wahhabism during his Hajj journey. Arberry comments that this notion was first raised by W. W. Hunter in ëIndian Mussulmansí, but was refuted by Syyed Abdul Barri in ëThe politics of Syed Ahmad Barelwií and by Syed Mahmud Hussain in ëHistory of the freedom movementsí. Arberry concludes that the Ahl ul Hadith movement was also accused of Wahhabism towards the end of the 19th Century. Our response to these comments is that the new era of Saudi rule began at the beginning of the 20th Century, when its leadership exerted their efforts to unite all the areas of the Arabian peninsula, and succeeded having been blessed with Allaahís Help. The Kingdom established good relations with its neighbours and it is a fact of history that the Kingdomís friends among the Arab states in particular and the Muslim countries in general have always outnumbered its enemies and critics. <br />
It is also another fact of history that the Kingdomís strong grip on the dogma of Tawheed (Oneness of Allaah) and their rejection of all signs of Shirk and superstitions is still as strong today as it was when the reformatory movement of the Sheikh began two hundred years ago. The secret of success lies in this, with the will of Allaah.<br />
Arberryís comments that Syyed Ahmad Shaheed was impressed by Wahhabism have been mentioned by others such as Morgoliouth. The famous author Masíud Alam An Nadawi has commented on this, saying,<br />
ëAnd similarly the renewal of the movement of Islaam and Imamate which began in India was so similar to the movement of Najd that even the supporters of the movements believed both movements to be the sameí.<br />
The similarities are not surprising since the roots of both movements lie in the Qurían and Sunnah. However, the movements do have distinctly different methods of daíwah and work, despite agreeing in principle. The movement of renewing Jihad which was established by Syyed Ahmad Shaheed (d. 1246 AH) and Sheikh Ismail Ash Shaheed (d. 1246) was not affected by the movement of Najd [17] . The Ahl ul Hadith in India were also labelled as Wahhabis because they too fought to refute all signs of Shirk, innovations and superstitions from the Muslims. <br />
Encyclopaedia Britannica<br />
Encyclopaedia Britannica: The movement of Wahhabism under Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab The author of the article claims that, <br />
ëHaving completed his formal education in the holy city of Medina, in Arabia, ëAbd al-Wahhab lived abroad for many years. He taught for four years in Basra, Iraq and in Baghdad married an affluent woman whose property he inherited when she died. In 1736 in Iran he began to teach against what he considered to be the extreme ideas of various exponents of Sufi doctrines.í [18]<br />
The article ends with a surprisingly refreshing praise of Sheikh ibn al Wahhab and comments that his followers preferred the title of ëMuwahhidooní. The term ëWahhabisí was a derogatory label used by their opponents. <br />
The lies concerning the Sheikhís travels have been attributed to Morgoliouth. In his article in the ëEncyclopaedia of Islamí, Morgoliouth includes the fabrication that the Sheikh married a wealthy lady in Baghdad from whom he inherited two thousand.<br />
He then travelled to Kurdistan, Hamdan, Qum and Isfahan. Other writers such as Palgrave, Zwemmer and Brigges in his ëBrief history of the Wahhabisí have also claimed that the Sheikh travelled beyond Baghdad and Damascus. But these claims are untrue, as there is no evidence of the Sheikh travelling beyond Basrah to Baghdad, Syria or Egypt. [19]<br />
Ameer Ali<br />
Ameer Ali: ëThe Spirit of Islamí <br />
The author was a member of the Judicial Committee of His Majestyís Privy Council in the early 20th Century, i.e. during the days of British colonial rule in India. He writes,<br />
ëIn Najd, under the rule of the Wahabis, who have been called the Covenanters of Islam, laggards were whipped into the mosque. And today under Ibn Saud, his followers who designate themselves Ikhwan, or ëBrothers in faithí, pursue the same method for enforcing the observance of religious rites. Prayers bil-jamaíat as being obligatory (farzíain) naturally made the presence of the Imam obligatory.í [20]<br />
Discussing the Azariqa, a faction of the Khawarij, he says, <br />
ëOf these the Azarika are the most fanatical, exclusive, and narrow. According to them, every sect besides their own is doomed to perdition, and ought to be forcibly converted or ruthlessly destroyed. No mercy ought to be shown to any infidel or Mushrik (an expansive term, including Muslims, Christians and Jews). To them every sin is of the same degree: murder, fornication, intoxication, smoking, all are damning offences against religion. Whilst other Muslims, Shiah as well as Sunni, hold that every child is born into the world in the faith of Islam, and remains so until perverted by education, the Azraki declares that the child of an infidel is an infidel. The orthodox Christian maintains that every child who is not baptized is doomed to perdition: the Khariji, like the Christian, declares that every child who has not pronounced the formula of faith is beyond the pale of salvation. The Azarika were destroyed by Hajjaj ibn Yusuf; but their sanguinary, fierce, and merciless doctrines found expression nine centuries later in Wahabism.í [21] <br />
He then says, <br />
ëThe Wahabis have been depicted in rather favourable colours by Mr. Palgrave, in his Travels in Central Arabia, but, in fact, they are the direct descendants of the Azarika, who after their defeat by Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, had taken refuge in the recesses of Central Arabia. Abdul Wahabís doctrines. bear the closest resemblance to those held so fiercely by the followers of Nafe ibn al-Azrak. Like them, the Wahabis designate all other Muslims as unbelievers, and permit their despoilment and enslavement. However commendable their revolt against the anthropolatrous usages in vogue among the modern Muslims, their views of religion and divine government, like those of the Ikhwan in the present day in Najd, are intensely morose and Calvinistic [22] , and in absolute conflict with progress and development.í [23]<br />
Our response to these claims is as follows: <br />
There is no disagreement among the different mazahib of Islaam regarding obligatory prayers. But there are some minor differences regarding the duty of the man to offer these prayers in a Masjid. Some held that it is obligatory if he is in the vicinity of a Masjid and hears the adhan, but others held it as a confirmed Sunnah. Muslim societies in general took it for granted that their men would attend the Masjid for prayer after hearing the adhan, and it was only in very recent times that laxity developed among some people. Al Ikhwan introduced a disciplinary punishment for those who were lazy in attending congregational prayers in order to counteract the lethargy that was developing. But this punishment was never needed on a large scale; in Saudi Arabia today, for example, an observor will notice people flocking to the Masajid at times of prayer, despite the absence of any forms of punishment for not doing so.<br />
The treatise of Sheikh Hamad bin Naasir bin Uthman Maímari An Najdi (d. 1225 AH) gives permission to fight those who do not pray out of laziness. He reports the consensus of all the Imaams except Az Zuhri. And this is the mazhab of the people known as Hanbalis. For the people of Najd, Anyone who abandons prayer voluntarily is regarded a Kafir. &lt;http://www.allaahuakbar.net/salaah/abandoning_the_prayer.htm&gt; [24]<br />
Ameer Aliís comments about the alleged resemblance between the Wahhabis and the Khawarij &lt;http://www.allaahuakbar.net/khawariji/index.htm&gt; are not new. Zaini Dahlan also took all the ahaadeeth pertaining to the Khawarij and applied them to the Wahhabis in his books ëAl Durrar al Sunniyaí and ëAl Futuhat al Islamiyyaí. [25]<br />
<br />
Ameer Aliís comments regarding the resemblance between the Wahhabis and the Khawarij, especially the Azariqa, shows his deep ignorance of the beliefs of Sheikh Ibn Abdul Wahhab, which were simply a renewal of the pure teachings of the Salaf. Let us hear the evidence of the mazhab of Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab.<br />
i) The Khawarij &lt;http://www.allaahuakbar.net/khawariji/index.htm&gt; declare any individual who commits a major sin to be a Kaafir. The Sheikh will only declare someone to be a Kaafir if the consensus of the entire Muslim ummah is that he is a Kaafir, and if the evidence has been made clear to him. The Sheikh did not declare someone a Kaafir if the evidence had not been presented to the wrongdoer. He says concerning people who commit the major sin of drinking alcohol,<br />
ëIf these people insist on declaring something which is haram to be halaal, they are to be labelled Kuffaar. But if they believe them to be haram but still partake of them, they are to be flogged. Our pious predecessors did not declare people to be Kuffaar for taking the haram to be halaal until the truth was made clear to these people. If they persisted despite the evidence, they could then be labelled Kuffaar.í [26] <br />
ii) The Khawarij declared it halaal to fight other factions if they had rebelled.<br />
The Sheikh said, ëAs far as fighting is concerned, we do not fight anyone except to defend our lives and honour. These people have invaded us in our own lands, and so have left no possible alternative. We may fight some of them for what they have done for us. The Qurían advises us, ëThe recompense for an evil is a similar evil.í And we can fight those who openly abuse the Deen of our Prophet (SAWS) after recognising it.í [27] <br />
iii) The Khawarij were known for their rebellion against Muslim leaders.<br />
<br />
They killed Syyedina Ali, May Allah be pleased with him, one of the Rightly Guided Caliphs. In ëThe Salafi beliefs of Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhabí, the author says, <br />
ëHe believes in the obligation to listen to and obey the Imaams of the Muslims, whether they are sinful or pious, as long as they do not ask the people to disobey Allaah. If a man takes the Caliphate and the people gather round him, or he dominates them with a sword until he becomes a Caliph, then obedience to him is incumbent and rebellion against him is haram.í [28]<br />
iv) One of the distinctive characteristics of the Azariqa is their belief that all the children of Kuffar are also Kuffar. For the belief of the Ahl us Sunnah wal Jamaíah and the followers of Sheikh Ibn Abdul Wahhab, we will record the religious verdict of the most prominent worker in daíwah of our times, Allamah Sheikh Ibn Abdul Aziz bin Baaz &lt;http://www.allaahuakbar.net/scholars/ibn_baaz/index.htm&gt;, may Allsah have.18 Mercy upon him: <br />
ëAccording to one saying of the scholars, The man to whom Da'wah did not reach, either because he was away from Islaam and the Muslims, or because he attained majority when he was mad, or the children of Kuffaar who die in childhood, all these people will be put to a trial on the Day of Judgement. Those who respond correctly to the trial will enter Al Jannah. Those who disobey will enter the Fire. And we seek safety from Allaah, the Almighty.í<br />
Because of the many authentic ahaadeeth on this issue, the correct opinion regarding the children of Kuffaar who die before coming of age is that they will be in paradise. [29]<br />
v) Ameer Ali admits the revolt of Wahhabis against anthropomorphism.<br />

He registers his displeasure with their displeasure with their rule, but does not explain why this is so. The Saudi Kingdom took upon its shoulders the duty of implementing the religion of Allaah and Islamic Sharee'ah. Among the blessings of this rule are the comfort, safety, security, peace and stability enjoyed in all areas under its rule. It has modernised and advanced in technology rapidly. Had Ameer Ali lived longer, he would have witnessed himself the falseness of his predictions for the end of the last century. And Allaah is the Accounter.<br />
Humphreyís ëMemoirsí<br />
This book 30 was translated into Urdu in India and it was claimed by its publishers that Humphrey was an English spy whose duty was to spy on the Ottoman caliphate in the 18th Century. He went through training in adopting an Islaamic identity and learning Arabic, and then travelled to Basra where he met Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab, and a strong friendship developed between the two. The Publishers claim that these memoirs remained hidden until they fell into the hands of the Germans during World War II, who published it as a way of slandering the British government. It was translated into French, Arabic and Urdu. A perusal of this book makes it abundantly clear that it is an imaginary fictional narrative, coined deliberately to discredit Sheikh ibn Abdul Wahhab and his followers by the British. Our evidence to prove the book is a concoction is twofold: historical evidence from its ****************************s, and our fruitless search to find the original English version. <br />
We began with a trip to the British Libraryís Rare Books Section, which contains books printed prior to 1975. There were 72 entries under Humphrey, but none related to our subject. We found one entry under Humphreyís Memoirs (printed 1734), but these were the memoirs of the Duke of Gloucester who recorded his relations with the ruling family of the time.<br />
<br />
The publishers of the offending book had also given a number of alternative titles such as ëColonisation Idealí and ëThe English spy in Islamic countriesí. Needless to say we found no such book, and neither did our search under ëspyí reveal anything useful. The advent of computers has made access to rare and remote books very easy, and we have been forced to conclude after an intensive search that no such book exists and that we have a fabricated translation published by the enemies of the Sheikh ibn Abdul Wahhab.<br />
Humphrey claims he travelled to Istanbul in 1710 at the age of 20. He returned to London and then travelled to Basrah in 1712 after a long sea journey lasting six months. This claim is irrational as sea travel between England and Gulf was not that long. He also claims to have met Shaikh At Taee, one of the Sheikhs of Basrah. He then met a carpenter of Iranian origins called Abdul Riza with whom he began working, and there he met a. young man who spoke Turkish, Persian and Arabic. He wore the garb of students and was known as Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab. [31] The claim of this acquaintance is clearly false. Sheikh ibn Abdul Wahhab was born in 1703, attaining majority at the age of twelve when his father arranged his marriage. After travelling to the Hijaz for the Hajj, he returned to Najd and stayed with his father to study. He did not travel to seek knowledge until 1722 when he travelled to Makkah, Madina and Basrah. There is thus no possibility of the Sheikh and the fictional Humphrey meeting in Basrah as the dates do not correspond. And all the scholars who have researched the biography of the Sheikh have rejected claims that the Sheikh travelled to Turkey and Persia. [32]<br />
The book claims that the Sheikh expressed a desire to travel to Istanbul, but was advised against it by Humphrey for fear of persecution from the Ottomans. He advised the Sheikh to travel to Isfahan instead, and the Sheikh did so. This too is a lie. Syyed Abdul Haleem al Jundi quotes in <br />
ëAl Imaam Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab ë the victory of the Salafi methodí, ëI discussed this with Sheikh ibn Baaz, who denied the journey to Kurdistan and Iran. Sheikh Ibn Baaz told me he took this information from his Sheikhs, including the grandchildren of Sheikh Ibn Abdul Wahhab, and especially his own Sheikh, Muhammad ibn Ibrahimí. [33]<br />
Humphrey claims that the Sheikh declared his Da'wah in 1143 AH. This is the only time he uses the hijrah calendar in his book. It also reveals his ignorance of historical facts, as the Sheikh returned to Huraymilah three years before the death of his father in 1153, and declared his Da'wah after the death of his father.<br />
There is yet more evidence that Humphrey was devoid of historical knowledge. Humphrey travelled to Istanbul in 1710, giving the ostensible reason that the British Empire was assigning great importance to its established colonies. The Empire was so vast it was said that the sun did not set within its boundaries. Although the British Isles were themselves relatively small, the extended territories including India, China and the Middle East were extensive and required careful governance. The Ministry for Colonies decided to recruit spies to gather information from the territories, and so Humphrey became involved. 34 <br />
It is historically inaccurate to place these events at the beginning of the 18th Century. India at the time was not a colony; the East India Company began trading in the 17th Century but had no political hold until 1757 when Bengal was captured. It began expanding until the rule of the Company was transferred to direct rule from England in 1857. Therefore, there was no Indian colony in 1710. There was also no British colonial involvement in China at the time; Hong Kong did not fall to the British until the Treaty of 1898.<br />
<br />
It is therefore clear that the inventor of the Memoirs has let his imagination run riot and abandon historical accuracy. He has set his story at the end of the 19th Century in the heyday of the British Empire, when the sun truly did not set on its colonies. But in doing so, he has exposed himself to be a writer of fiction, not fact.<br />
The author attributes many actions and words to the Sheikh which are at clear odds with the beliefs, teachings and distinctly Islamic character of the Sheikh. There is no need to discuss these filthy slanders in any detail, as the authenticity of the facts in the book has been proven to be false.<br />
In order to lend credibility to his ëmemoirsí, the author sprinkles the novel with stories of plots by the British government to disunite the Muslims; to create ideological and religious upheaval among them; to spread evil among their men and women; to distance them from Arabic, the language of the Qurían; to encourage the use of national and social languages; to establish missionary schools; and to weaken the position of the Muslims politically and economically.<br />
<br />
I have attempted to prove the fabrication of this book through its historical inaccuracy and doubtful authorship, as I believe that no one else has done so yet. In fact, a book as insignificant as this does not deserve even a second glance, let alone a serious critical study. But from a sense of duty and Amanah, I decided to shed light on the lies contained within it. And Allaah knows best the intentions.<br />
Arnold<br />
Let us end this paper with the very perceptive remarks of Prof. Arnold about the Wahhabi movement in ëPreaching of Islamí: ëAt the present day there are two chief factors that make for missionary activity in the Muslim world. The first of these is the revival of religious life which dates from the Wahhabi reformation at the end of the eighteenth Century; though this new departure has long lost all political significance outside the confines of Najd[35], as a religious revival its influence is felt throughout Africa, India and the Malay Archipelago even to the present day, and has given birth to numerous movements which take rank among the most powerful influences in the Islamic world. In the preceding pages it has already been shown how closely connected many of the modern Muslim missions are with this widespread revival: the fervid zeal it has stirred up, the new life it has infused into existing religious institutions, the impetus it has given to theological study and to the organisation of devotional exercises, have all served to awake and keep alive the innate proselytising spirit of Islam.í [36] <br />
