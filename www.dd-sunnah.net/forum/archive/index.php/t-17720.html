<br />
A Scholar of the Sunna vs. A Scholar of the Shia  <br />
Ibn Taymiyya vs. Ibn Mutahhira <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: The Imama (Question of Leadership) is the most important of the religious matters. If it is safeguarded, then security and honor is widespread. It is also one of the pillars of faith, because the Messenger of Allah  said, &quot;Whoever dies without knowing the Imam of his time, dies a death of jahiliyya.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: To say &quot;the Imama is the most important of religious matters&quot; is a lie, because every-one agrees hat faith (iman) is the most important matter. It is well known that when the kuffar became Muslims during the time of the Messenger , he used to tell them the rules of Islam and he did not tell them about the imama. How can it then be the most important of affairs?<br />
<br />
How is it that faith that Muhammad bin Hasan is the imam be more important than faith  in Allah, His angles, books, and messengers, and the meeting with him?  Bare in mind that his coming has been awaited from the cave of Samurra' for over four hundred and sixty some odd years (as of the time of this treatise was authored, now it has been more than 1100 years). <br />
<br />
Furthermore, your statement that &quot;the imama is one of the pillars of the religion&quot; is laden with ignorance and is a great lie, because the Prophet  explained iman and its branches, yet did not mention imama among them, nor did this come in the Qur'an.<br />
<br />
As for the hadeeth you mentioned, we say, who narrated this hadeeth? Where is its isnad?1 The Prophet , by Allah, did not say it like that. <br />
<br />
Even if we assume the hadeeth to be correct, it would be evidence against you not for you. Who amongst you knows the imam of this age, or has seen him, or seen one who has seen him, or heard anything from him? You only point to a young boy, three or five years old, who entered a cave over four hundred years ago, and no one has seen or heard of him since. We have only been commanded to obey imams who are present and well-known to be in power, and to obey them in what is correct and not in the wrong.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Allah, the Glorious, has placed infallible people on the world so that it would not be  empty of His mercy due to their just rule.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: You say &quot;the infallible imams have been oppressed, over-run, weak, and had no power or control.&quot; You apply this to Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, ever since the death of the Messenger of Allah  till he was appointed khaliph, and to the rest of the eleven imams. You affirm that Allah, the Glorious, did not establish them, nor give them power. If it is said that the intended meaning of their being imams is unconditional obedience to them, that they guide whoever obeys them, the vast majority did not turn to them for guidance.  <br />
<br />
Therefore, it may be said, no mercy appeared in the world due to their presence. What happened in reality is that people disobeyed them, and the awaited imam, the twelfth one, benefited neither those who believe in his presence nor those who dismiss him as a hoax.2 The imams, with the exception of Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, were in the umma as scholars, as any other scholar. As for being in the position of a powerful leader, they did not attain that position. Therefore it becomes clear that your saying that their just rule is a mercy is a deceptive lie.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: The infallible ones got their infallibility from their grand-father.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: In fact they learned the hadeeth of their grand-father from the scholars. This is mutawatir (known through numerous independent sources that it is considered an indisputable fact). Ali ibn al-Husain narrates from Abban bin Uthman from Usama ibn Zaid, while Muhammad bin Ali narrates from Jabir and others. None of them except Ali and his two sons met the Prophet personally.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: We narrate from our predecessors until the chain ends with one of the infallible ones.3<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: If what you say is true, then a narration from one infallible person is enough.  What need is there for a new infallible person in every era? If narration is sufficient, then you are ignorant of and are missing four hundred and sixty sunnas.<br />
<br />
Then again,  the lies which the Rawafid (Shia) tell about the imams exceeds the limits, notwithstanding Ja'far As-Sadiq. To the extent that they falsely ascribe to him Kitab Al-Jafr, Al-Bitaqa, Manafi' Al-Qur'an, Ahkam ar-Ru'ud wal Buruq, and Kitab Ikhtilaj Al-A'daa. How can anyone trust the narration of a group in which lies are so rampant, especially when the truthfulness of the narrator is not known, nor the continuousness of the chain. Imam Malik used to say, &quot;Treat the hadeeths of the people of Iraq as the hadeeths of the people of the book. Don't believe them nor belie them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: They (Shia) took their methodology (madh-hab) from the infallible ones.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: We don't affirm that you took your madh-hab from the ahlul-bayt (i.e. the house-hold of the Messenger ). You diverge from Ali, may Allah be please with him, and the imams of ahlul-bayt in the fundamental matters and the branches. They used to affirm the attributes of Allah, the qadar, the khilafa of the three (may Allah be pleased with them) and their excellence.<br />
<br />
You don't even have continuous chains of narration so that we can study them, and lies are rampant among you. You need two things to prove the authenticity of your madh-hab. First, the infallibility of the one to whom the madh-hab is attributed. Second, the authenticity of the narration from him. On both counts, you have nothing to show.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: The Followers of the Way of the Messenger (AhlusSunna) say that Allah is oppressive and does vain things.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: No Muslim said this statement. Allah is free from that. The AhlusSunna rather say, &quot;Allah created the actions of his slaves,&quot; because He is the creator of all things (as in Sura al-An'aam, aya 103) and the actions are done by the creatures, and this is not oppression from their creator. For instance, if He created their worship, hajj, and fasting, he is not the one who makes hajj, or fasts, or worships. He also created their hunger, yet that does not mean he becomes hungry because of this. If Allah creates something, attribute, or event, Allah does not become describe in that attribute or action.  If that was so, then He would be characterized by everything He created.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: They (AhlusSunna) say that the obedient person does not deserve reward, nor the disobedient deserve punishment... that even the Prophet  could be punished and iblees be forgiven.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This is another statement falsely attributed to AhlusSunna. None amongst them says a prophet would be punished, nor that iblees would be forgiven. What they do say is that a sin may be forgiven, and those who commit major sins may come out of the fire, so that none of the people of tawheed (pure monotheism) will remain in it forever. <br />
<br />
As for deserving reward or punishment, they say, &quot;The servant does not, by himself, deserve anything from Allah.&quot;  They say that Allah, Glory be to Him, will surely reward those who obey him as he promised, because he does not break His promise. When it comes to specifying how that will happen, then that is impossible for the mind to fathom. However, if he wanted to punish whomever He willed, nobody could prevent Him. As He said, &quot;Who then will prevent Allah if He wanted to destroy the Messiah, son of Marry, and his mother, and everyone else on the earth?&quot; (Al-Maa-ida, 17).<br />
<br />
He, the Almighty, punishes whoever is questioned about his works, as His messenger  said, &quot;Whoever is questioned about his account is punished.&quot;  He  also said, &quot;None of you enters janna based on your works.&quot;  They said not even you O messenger of Allah? He said, &quot;Not even me, unless Allah covers me with his mercy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that if Allah, the Most High, punishes anyone, then that has a justification because He does not oppress.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: AhlusSunna say that the Prophet  did not specify anyone as imam, and that he died without a wasiyya (will).<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: Not all of them say this. A group of them say that Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, was specified as imam by the Prophet  .  Ibn Hamid said, &quot;The proof that Abu Bakr's khilafa was specified by the Prophet is what Al-Bukhari recorded from Jubair ibn Mut'am, when he said, &quot; A woman came to the Prophet , so he told her to come back to him. She said what if I come back and not find you? (As if she meant death) He said if you don't find me, go to Abu Bakr.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: They say, &quot;The prophets are not protected from error [infallible].&quot;<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: Wrong. In fact, they agree that they are infallible in delivering the message, and this is their job as messengers. They are free of all what counters their being prophets.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: It is not fitting for prophets to forget.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: I don't know anyone who says this.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: The Ash'aris say that Allah can be seen with the eye, while He is free of directions, and He said, &quot;Vision does not encompass Him&quot; (Al-An'aam, 103).<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: As for seeing Him in the hereafter with our eyes, then that is what our predecessors and their leading scholars said. It has been transmitted from the messenger through numerous channels. The Messenger  said, &quot;You will see your Lord, the Mighty and Glorious, on the day of resurrection as you see the sun. You will have no difficulty in seeing Him&quot; (Al-Bukhari &amp; Muslim). In another narration, he said, &quot;Do you find any difficulty seeing the sun in a cloudless sky?&quot; They said no. He said, &quot;Do you have any problem seeing the full moon when there is no cloud in the sky?&quot; They said no. He said, &quot;Truly you will see your lord as you see the sun and the moon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: The AhlusSunna take comparison (qiyas) and opinions, thereby they introduced in the religion things that were not part of it. They also changed the rules of the Islamic way.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This actually applies to you. The Zaydiyya, for instance accepts qiyas, and qiyas, for your information is, is better than blind following of those who have not reached the level of knowledge of the mujtahids.  Ath-Thawri, Ash-Shafi'i, and Ahmad, and these are more knowledgeable and have more insight than the Askari's.<br />
<br />
As for your saying, &quot;They introduced in the religion things that were not part of it,&quot; this is not found in any group more than the Rawafid. They invented more lies on the tongue of the Messenger  than anyone else. They also rejected countless truths, and changed the meanings of the Qur'an. They read &quot;Maraj al-Bahrain&quot; (the boarders of the two oceans,  Ref: S. Ar-Rahman), and say it means Ali and Fatima. They read &quot;Yakhruju minhumal-Lu'lu wal Marjan&quot; (Pearls and coral come out of them), and say it means Hasan and Hussein. They read &quot;Ash-Shajaratal Mal'una&quot; (the cursed tree), and say banu Umayya. &quot;An tadhbahu baqara&quot; (that you slaughter a cow), and the say A'isha (may Allah be pleased with her). &quot;La-in ashrakta layahbatanna amaluk&quot; (if you associate (others with Allah), your works will come to naught), and say if you associate Abu Bakr and Umar in khilafa (may Allah be pleased with them). These are some examples which I found in their books.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: The Imaamiya (Shiites) are sure that they and their imams will be saved, while the AhlusSunna don't make definitive claims to that effect.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: If complete obedience to the imams you call to is correct, and that it is a guarantee to being saved, you should know that followers of the khulafa' of banu Umayya used to believe that obedience to those imams was obligatory under all circumstances. They believed that Allah did not question the imam for his sins, and that they incur no sin for anything they do in his obedience. These people have a stronger argument for their case than the Shiites because they used to obey imams whom Allah had empowered and gave them control of the land.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the AhlusSunna say with more certainty than the Rawafid, that their imams are saved. This is because their imams after the Prophet  were the first and foremost among the Muhajireen and the Ansar. They firmly affirm that these are saved. They also bear witness that the ten promised paradise are saved, and that Allah said to those who participated in the Battle of Badr, &quot;Do what you will, for I have forgiven you.&quot; They also say that none will enter the fire from those who pledged under the tree, as it has been confirmed in the authentic hadeeth from the Prophet . These are more than a thousand four hundred imams of AhlusSunna, among whom they say none will enter the fire. This testimony is based upon knowledge derived from the Book and the Sunna, unlike the Rawafid. For if they testify, they testify to what they don't know, and if they testify to a falsehood which they know to be a lie. The are as Ash-Shafi'i , &quot;I have never seen a people more giving to false testimony than the Rafida.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: They (the AhlusSunna) have invented four madh-hab and disregarded statements of the sahaba.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: Since when has it been wrong to disregard the sahaba with you? And who is it that disregards the consensus of the sahaba? Us or you? Who is it that called them astray and kuffar? Truly, it is unimaginable for the AhlusSunna to agree on something in opposition to the consensus of the sahaba.<br />
<br />
As for the Imamiyya, for sure, they diverge from the Prophet's {atra} way as well as diverging from the consensus of the sahaba. There was nobody in the time of the Prophet , or of Abu Bakr, or of Umar, or Uthman or Ali (May Allah be pleased with them) who said that there will be twelve infallible imams, or of the infallibility of anyone after the Prophet , or that the three khalifas were kuffar (may Allah be pleased with them). In fact, nobody even tried to pock holes in their status as leaders. The Imamiyya, no doubt , by consensus diverge from the Prophetic way, along with separating from the way of the sahaba. How can they, after all this, criticize anyone for diverging from the way of the sahaba?<br />
<br />
As for the madh-hab, if what was meant is that the AhlusSunna agreed to initiate them in order to diverge from the sahaba (may Allah be pleased with them), then this is a lie. The four jurists (may Allah be pleased with them) did not appear at the same time, nor was there among them one who imitated the other, nor did anyone of them tell the people to follow him. The fact is that each of them called to the book and the sunna, and that their statements should be rejected if found in conflict with the book or the sunna. If you say, &quot;The people follow the four,&quot; then everyone knows this. The four did not invent new knowledge which did not already exist. Rather, the collected the knowledge and that compilation was credited to them. Also, the AhlusSunna do not say that the consensus of the four is an infallible proof, nor that the truth is only to be found in what they said, nor did they declare everything outside their teachings to be false.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Some of them were greedy for power and most of the people pledged allegiance to them because they were after the world.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: Do you mean Abu Bakr? It is well known that Abu-Bakr did not nominate himself for the khilafa. What he said was, &quot;I am pleased with either Umar, Abdur-Rahman, or Abu Sa'd. Umar then said, &quot;By Allah, that my neck be struck is more beloved to me that to be in charge of a people while Abu Bakr is amongst them.&quot; The only reason why Umar, Abu Ubaida and the rest of the Muslims picked him and pledged allegiance for him is because they knew he was their best. The Prophet  has also said, &quot;Allah and the believers refuse anyone except Abu-Bakr.&quot;<br />
<br />
Furthermore, assuming that he nominated himself and they pledged allegiance to him, still your claim that they pledged allegiance to him because they were after worldly benefit is obviously mistaken, for he did not give them the world. He spent his own wealth in the lifetime of the Prophet  and what remained in his hand was little, and those who pledged allegiance to him were of the most disinterested of the world. In addition, there was not a state treasury (baytul-mal) established when the Prophet  died from which he could spend. It was also his regular manner to be equitable in spending war booty among the people.<br />
<br />
What worldly benefit did they get from pledging allegiance to Abu Bakr? He used to give to the early Muslims as much as the later individuals, saying, &quot;Truly they submitted to Allah, and their reward is with Allah. As for these provisions, they're only to help reach the destination.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: They called him 'The Khalifa of the Messenger of God', but the Prophet never made him khalifa while he was alive nor after his death. They did not call Ali Khalifa of Rasulillah, while he did leave him as khalifa over Madina, and he  said, &quot;Madina will never be well, except through me or you&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: According to the linguists, the meaning of khalifa is one that succeeds another, or one that is made to succeed by another, as the Shia and some of the Zahiriyya say.<br />
<br />
Based on the first definition, Abu Bakr  is khalifa of Allah's messenger . He succeeded him after his death, and ran the affairs in his place. He was most deserving of it, and was well suited for it, so it was natural that he be the khalifa instead of all else. The Shia and others don't argue that he became head of state after the Prophet , and became his khalifa, lead the Muslims in prayer and ********************istered the law, distributed the booty, appointed people as governors, and carried out battles. All these duties, as everyone knows, were on the shoulders of Abu Bakr after the death of the Prophet . Therefore, he was the khalifa of the Allah's messenger .<br />
<br />
As for the Messenger's making Ali  over Madina, then that is not something particular to him. He had also left Ibn Maktum, Uthman ibn Affan, and Abul-Mundhir (may Allah be pleased with them all). This is not an unrestricted succession, which is why none of these said they were khalifa of Allah's messenger  without specifying the conditions under which they were so.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the Prophet  likened Ali  to Harun  because of the general similarity of the situation and not because of the absolute similarity between their being left behind while the messengers (Muhammad and Musa, may peace be upon both) were away. As for your statement that the Prophet  said, &quot;Madina will never be well, except through me or you,&quot; this is false and fabricated (Adh-Dhahabi checked it and said that Abdullah bin Bakeer Al-Ghanawi is found in its chain, and his hadeeth is munkar from Hakeem bin Jubair, and is weak. Al-Hakim, as Adh-Dhahabi mentioned, was lenient in grading hadeeth, which was why he said it was sahih. Ibn al-Jawzi also mentioned this hadeeth in his compilation of the fabricated hadeeths, Al-Mawdoo'aat vol. 1, pg 357). Also, Ali left Madina along with the Prophet  to Badr, Hunain and other places and left others in Madina as his khulafaa'.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: The AhlusSunna say, &quot;Indeed the imam after the Prophet  was Abu Bakr because Umar pledged allegiance to him with the agreement of four people.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: On the contrary, all pledged allegiance to him and they all agreed upon that, whether you like it or not. The abstention of Sa'd alone cannot be used as a counter-argument either. For instance, when the pledge was taken for Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), a size able number of the sahaba and tabi'een abstained, and only Allah knows how many they were. Does that prove the illegitimacy of Ali's khilafa? The approach of AhlusSunna is that the imama is established when the people of influence decide it. They are those who have both the ability to handle the matter and have the power to carry it through.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: The Prophet  never left Abu Bakr in charge of anything, and when he sent him with sura al-Bara'a, Allah sent revelation ordering him to recall him.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This is obviously a lie. It is well known that the Prophet  put him as the head of the hajj in the 9th year of hijra. This is one of the things only he had been chosen for, as was his being left in charge of leading the prayers. Ali  was among those upon whom Abu Bakr had been left in charge in the hajj, because when Ali caught up with Abu Bakr, Abu Bakr asked him, &quot;(have you been sent as) An ameer or as one under an ameer?&quot; He replied, &quot;No, as one under an ameer.&quot; And Ali, (may Allah be pleased with him) used to pray behind Abu Bakr  along with all the other Muslims in this hajj. It is true that Ali did read out al Baraa-a.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Abu Bakr cut the hand of a thief and was ignorant of the fact that it is the right hand that was supposed to be cut.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This is another great lie. However, if we were to assume that Abu Bakr used to allowed this, then what's wrong with it? The Qur'an does not designate the right hand, but in Ibn Masoud's recitation it is (faqta'oo aymaanahum) and this is how the sunna was. The question is, where is the report that says Abu Bakr  cut the left hand? and Where is the authentic chain? These are the books of the scholars containing the reports, and this is not in them.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Abu Bakr did not know most of the laws of the sharee'a.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: How can he possibly be ignorant of the majority of the rulings when nobody used to give judgment (fatwas) in the presence of the Prophet  except him? Moreover, the Prophet  did not use to consult anyone more than he consulted him and Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both).<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Abu Bakr did not carry out Allah's judgment. He did not punish Khalid ibn Al-Waleed when he killed Malik ibn Nuwairah, while Umar advised that he should be killed.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: If the not killing one who killed another was something to be held against someone, then this would be the greatest of proofs for the Shia of Uthman upon Ali (may Allah be pleased with them). Truly, Uthman was better than the likes of Malik ibn Nuwairah. Uthman was killed wrongfully and was shaheed, and Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) did not punish his killers. This is why the people of Sham abstained from pledging allegiance to him. If you excuse Ali, then excuse Abu Bakr (may Allah be please with him), as for as we excuse both.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Abu Bakr would not give Fatima her inheritance. He wanted it for himself, and he justified not giving it to Fatima based on a narration which he alone transmitted, saying that the Prophet  said, &quot;We prophets are not inherited, whatever we leave behind is charity.&quot; His statement contradicts the Qur'an, because the Most High said, &quot;Solomon inherited David...&quot; (An-Naml 16), and He said that Zacharia said, &quot;Grant me one who will inherit from me&quot; (Maryam 5-6).<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: Your statement that this was &quot;a narration which he alone transmitted&quot; is a lie. On the contrary, Umar, Uthman, Ali, Talha, Az-Zubair, Abdur-Rahman bin Auf, Al-Abbas, the wives of the Prophet  and Abu Huraira narrated this in addition to Abu Bakr. Furthermore, your statement that &quot;he wanted it for himself&quot; is a lie. Abu Bakr  did not claim it for himself, rather it was sadaqa for those who deserve it. Also, the sahaba were convinced, and Ali  was one of them, that the Prophet  is not inherited. This is why when Ali became khalifa, he did not distribute the former property of the Prophet  or change the way it was being managed.<br />
<br />
In addition, the saying of the Most High, &quot;Solomon inherited David...&quot; does not serve as proof in this case because the term &quot;inherit&quot; is a general term which has many common usages. It can be used in terms of knowledge, kingdom, etc., as the Most High said, &quot;Then we gave the Book as inheritance to those whom we chose&quot; (Fatir 32), and He said, &quot;This is the janna which you have been made to inherit&quot; (Zukhruf 32), and His said, &quot;I will let you inherit the land&quot; (Al-A'raf 128), and He said, &quot;We gave as inheritance to the people who used to be oppressed&quot; (Al-A'raf 137).<br />
<br />
Also, Abu Dawud narrated that the Prophet, peace be upon him, said, &quot;The prophets did not leave for inheritance dirham nor dinar (dollars and cents), rather they left knowledge as an inheritance.&quot; Then it is to be said that &quot;inheritance&quot; in this sense is knowledge and prophethood, not wealth.<br />
<br />
It is well known that David  had many sons other than Solomon , then was Solomon a special inheritor because he got the wealth? There is nothing praiseworthy about inheriting money, because both disobedient and righteous persons inherit it, and the above quoted statement of Allah singled out Solomon for something special he inherited. The inheritance of money is something normal among the people, and the likes of this has no use of being mentioned because it adds no new knowledge. Similar to this is Zacharia's statement, &quot;One who would inherit from me and from the family of Jacob&quot; (Maryam 6), because this person does not inherit the wealth of the family of Jacob, rather, it is their children who inherit this. Also, Zacharia did not possess much wealth, he used to be a carpenter, and John/Yahya  was of the most ascetic of people.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: When she mentioned that her father gave her Fadak (a land located two day's journey from Madina), Abu Bakr told her to bring a witness, so she came with Umm Ayman. He said, &quot;This is a woman, her word is not acceptable.&quot; So she came with Ali and he bore witness for her. He said, &quot;This is your husband and has an interest in the matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This is not the first lie to come from the Rawafid, nor is it the first calumny. On top of that, if Fatima had claimed to receive Fadak based on inheritance, that means it wasn't given as gift. If it was a gift, then the case for the inheritance is baseless. If it so happens that it was given to her by the Prophet  during his final illness, then he is above making a will to one of his inheritors with more than the fair share. If he was in good health when he gave it to her, then the property should have changed hands. Otherwise, if the giver gives by word of mouth, and the one to whom it is given does not claim any part of it until the death of the giver, then that is invalid according to the masses of the scholars. Then how can it be that the Prophet, may peace be upon him, gave Fadak to Fatima, and the matter not be well known to his household and the Muslims, so much so that only Umm Ayman and Ali knew about it, may Allah be pleased with them. In fact, it is a lie upon Fatima to say that she made this claim.<br />
<br />
If it was possible to inherit from the Prophet , then the wives of the Prophet would have wanted their shares also, as well as his uncle (may Allah be pleased with them). The testimony of one man and one woman would not have been sufficient to deny them their inheritance according to the book of Allah, the Most High, and the sunna of His messenger , and the consensus of the Muslims. If it was not possible to inherit from the Prophet , then the Muslims would have wanted their share of sadaqa. Therefore, as before, their share cannot be denied based on the testimony of one woman and/or man, and this is by consensus of the Muslims.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Usama was appointed as head of an army, and among the people in the army were Abu Bakr and Umar. Usama was neither called the khalifa of Allah's messenger , and when Abu Bakr took charge of matters, Usama angrily said, &quot;I was put in charge over you, so who is it that made you an authority over me? So Abu Bakr and Umar went to him to reconcile with him.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: Abu Bakr  was not in Usama's army (may Allah be pleased with him). The truth is that the Prophet  left him in charge of leading the prayers when his illness began. As for the leaders of the battles, such as Usama and others, these are not called khalifas because they did not fill the emptiness left by the Prophet  after his death, nor were they left in charge of everything in his lifetime.<br />
<br />
As for Usama  getting angry, it is a cold, dead on arrival lie, because Usama was the farthest one from seeking discord and difference. He did not take part in the battles between Ali and Mu'awiya (may Allah be pleased with them). He was also not from Quraysh. On top of that, assuming that the Prophet  had put him in charge over Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) and Abu Bakr became khalifa after the Prophet's death. Then it would still be up to the khalifa to send or halt the army, and to appoint Usama as ameer or removing him. None but the ignorant deny this.<br />
<br />
I wonder at these speakers of lies and what they say, that &quot;Abu Bakr and Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) went to him to reconcile with him,&quot; while they say that they forced Ali, al-Abbas, all Bani Hashim Bani Abd Manaf into accepting them and did not seek to reconcile with them. What need do those who have overpowered the best of Quraysh have to reconcile with a small nineteen year old who had no wealth or background of supporters?<br />
<br />
If they say, &quot;They reconciled with him because the Messenger  loved him and put him as head of the army.&quot;<br />
<br />
It is answered, &quot;But you claim that they disregarded his orders and his will, .&quot;<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Abu Bakr has also said, &quot;Correct me, for I am not the best of you.&quot; If his leadership was truly valid, then correcting him would be disobedience to him, and if his imama was invalid, then it is only right to discredit him.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This is a lie, and it has no isnad. What has been authenticated is that he said, in the day of the Saqeefa, &quot;Choose one of these two men as your leader, Abu Ubaida or Umar bin Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with them). Then Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said, &quot;No, you are our superior, the best of us, and the most beloved to Allah's messenger, may Allah send peace and blessings upon him.&quot; Then it is asked, why didn't Ali get picked for khilafa (may Allah be pleased with him) as soon as the Prophet  died? Besides, there is nothing wrong with the imam seeking to be corrected to lighten the burden leadership, and a person's humility does not bring him down from his status.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Umar said, &quot;The pledge to Abu Bakr was a slip from whose evil has kept back, and whoever does something like it again, kill him&quot;<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This last statement is a calumny and a great lie. What he said was, &quot;And there is none among as agreeable to everyone as Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him).&quot; Its meaning is that the pledge to Abu Bakr was quick and did not take much time because he stood out among the people.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Abu Bakr also said, &quot;I wish I had asked Allah's messenger  if the Ansar have any share in this matter.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This is a lie. Then we add, this statement if true, conflicts with your claim that Ali  was specified, because if that was the case, clearly the Ansar and others would have no share in it.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Also, the Prophet  during his final illness repeatedly said, &quot;Send out the army of Usama. May Allah's curse be on those who stay back from the army of Usama.&quot; The three were with him (Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman?), and Abu Bakr prevented Umar from going.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This is clearly a lie obvious to anyone who knows the seera. How could he send Abu Bakr in the army of Usama when he had left him in charge of leading the prayers? He lead them in prayers for twelve days, according to numerous continuously transmitted narrations. Also, the Prophet  saw the people on Monday morning when they were praying behind Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), and he smiled on seeing them thus. How can it be that he ordered him to leave while ordering him to lead the people to lead the people in prayers? What happened was that Abu Bakr sent Usama's Army out after the Prophet's death , and he asked Usama to excuse Umar  because he wanted to benefit from his sincere advice for Islam, and Usama excused him. Some told Abu Bakr to cancel Usama's mission because they feared that people may be emboldened to attack them due to the Prophet's death . Abu Bakr refused this saying, &quot;I will not untie a knot tied by the Prophet &quot;.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: They narrate that Abu Bakr said on the pulpit, &quot;Truly, the Prophet  used to be directed by revelation, and I am hounded by a satan who tries to mislead me. If I hold on to what is correct, then help me, and if I stray, make me go back to the what is right.&quot; How is it possible to for one who depends of those under him for guidance to be imam?<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This is one of his greatest merits. First of all, he was not one looking for power.  He was also not an oppressor, which is why he said to help him so long as he obeys (Allah and His messenger), and if he strays he asked to be corrected. The satan who tries to make him slip also tries to make others slip. There is no one who does not have a companion, one jinn and one angle, and satan runs through the son of Adam as blood through the veins. What Abu Bakr meant by his statement is that he was not infallible, and he was right . The imam is not a god for his flock such that he is in no need of them. On the contrary, they help each other upon righteousness and piety. On a separate note, it may be pointed out that Ali's dependence on his flock was more that that of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with them both).<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Uthman appointed as governors and ********************istrators incapable people. So much so that some of them were openly corrupt. He also distributed positions of influence to his close family members.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: First of all, Ali's appointees (may Allah be pleased with him) were more corrupt and disobedient than Uthman's appointees . It is true that Ali  put Ziyad bin Abu Sufyan, Abu Ubaidullah bin Ziyad, ,the killer of Hussain. He also appointed Al-Ashtar and Muhammad bin Abi Bakr. Mu'awiya was better than all these. It is strange that the Shi'a frown upon Uthman  for things present in Ali in greater amounts. They say, &quot;Uthman appointed his relatives from Bani Umayya.&quot; While Ali appointed his relatives, such as Abdullah ibn Al-Abbas and Ubaidullah ibn Al-Abbas, the sons of his uncle. Also Qutham bin Al-Abbas and Thumama ibn Al-Abbas. He also put over Egypt his adopted son, Muhammad bin Abi Bakr, whom he raised in his house, the son of his sister Umm Hani.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the Rawafid claim that Ali specified his son to be khalifa after him. If it is an evil thing to appoint a relative to some post, then it is a greater wrong to appoint them as khalifa. Also, appointing one's own children would more worthy of rebuke than appointing cousins.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Uthman beat Ibn Mas'oud till he died.  <br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This is clearly a lie... It was also said that Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) hit Ammar and Ibn Mas'oud (may Allah be pleased with them). Even if this was true, know that Uthman was the head of state, and he had the right to impose punishments depending on the circumstances, he could have been right or wrong.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: The messenger of Allah  sent Al-Hakam and his son out of Madina, but Uthman brought them back.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: Marwan was less than seven years old at the time, so he did not do anything to deserve banishment. We also have nothing to indicate that his father migrated to Madina in the first place so that he could be sent out from it. None of those who accepted Islam after the liberation of Mecca made hijra, because the Messenger  said, &quot;There's no hijra after the liberation [fath],&quot; so when Safwan bin Umayya came to Madina as a muhajir after that, the Prophet told him to return to Mecca.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the story of Al-Hakam's banishment does not have a chain of narrators from which we could tell its authenticity. If he was banished, then it would be from Mecca, not Madina. Yet if it so happened that he was banished from Madina, he would have been sent to Mecca. A lot of the scholars have criticized the story of his banishment and said, &quot;He left on his own free will.&quot; Even if he was banished, we find in the Shari'a some instances of banishment for certain crimes for specified amounts of time. There is no crime for which banishment has been prescribed indefinitely. The longest period known is one year. Therefore, it can be demonstrated clearly that Uthman didn't let Al-Hakam enter Madina in disobedience to the Prophet .<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Uthman also banished Abu Dhar to Ar-Rabdha.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: It has been authentically narrated from Abdullah bin As-Samit, who said that Umm Dhar said, &quot;By Allah Uthman did not force Abu Dhar to go to Ar-Rabdha, but the messenger of Allah  said, &quot;If the buildings (of Madina) reach Sal'a, then leave it'.&quot; In addition, Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, &quot;God forbid, that Uthman should force him out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: He added the adhan and that is bid'a.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: Ali  was among those who agreed with him in doing that, and he did not change it during his own khilafa. Changing this was much easier for him than removing Mu'awiyya (may Allah be pleased with him) and fighting him as well as others. If it was argued that the people would not have cooperated with him in changing the adhan, we say, this is a proof that the people agreed with Uthman, including the likes of Ammar and Sahl bin Hunaif among other early Muslims (may Allah be pleased with them). On the other hand, if the people differ in it, then this is an issue of ijtihad. Then if it is argued that this is a bid'a, then it is said, fighting the ahlul-qibla is also a bid'a, something which never happened before. You also have added to the adhan what the Allah's messenger  did not permit, and that is your saying, &quot;Hayya alaa khairil amal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: It is said that Uthman did not even attend Badr, nor the Bai'a of Ridwan, and he ran away in the battle of Uhud.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This was not said by anyone except the ignorant ones among the Rawafid who fought against him. Uthman and Ibn Umar have dealt with these accusations: The Prophet  ordered him to stay behind on the day of Badr to look after his wife, the daughter of the Prophet , who had been ill; He missed the Bai'a because the Prophet sent him as a messenger to Mecca and rumors spread that he was killed, which was the reason the Bai'a was taken to avenge for Uthman; and about those who turned back of the day of Uhud, the Most High said, &quot;Then he relieved you of them. Allah has forgiven you, and Allah is favorable to the believers&quot; (Aal Imran, 155).<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: There was a consensus that Uthman should be killed.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This is another lie. The masses did not order his killing nor were they pleased with it. Most of the Muslims at the time were not in Madina, they were in the outlaying countries... from West Africa to Khurasan, and none of the best of the Muslims were involved in the matter. Those who killed him were a disruptive group. There is a narration from Ali  in which he said, &quot;O Allah, curse the killers of Uthman  whether they be on land, sea, valley, or mountain.&quot;<br />
<br />
It is well know that the Muslims had a consensus in pledging to Uthman, not in killing him. Your claim that Uthman was killed by consensus is like what those who killed Hussain said, that he was killed by consensus of the Muslims, because those who fought him and killed him were not repelled by anyone. The falsehood of their claim is no more obvious than the falsehood of the claim of those who say that Uthman was killed by consensus. The uproar, tumult, and confusion caused by the killing of Hussain  was not as huge as the one caused by that of Uthman's (may Allah be pleased with him).<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: The imam must be better than his flock, and Ali was the best of his era, so he is the imam, since it is illogical to prefer less than the best when the best is available.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: We don't accept it as a given that Ali is the best of his era, because he said on the pulpit of Kufa, &quot;The best of this Umma after its Prophet is Abu Bakr, then Umar.&quot; Then most of the scholars stop specifying who the next best is.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Ahmad ibn Hanbal narrated that Anas said to Salman, &quot;Ask the Prophet who he his successor was&quot;. He asked him and he said, &quot;O Salman, who was the Moses' successor?&quot; He said, &quot;Joshua.&quot; So he said, &quot;My successor and inheritor is Ali.&quot; (Fabricated. Ibn Jowzi mentions it in his book of fabricated hadeeths, Al-Mawduat 1/374 and As-Suyuti in Al-La-aali 1/358)<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This Hadith is a lie, a fabrication, according to the people who possess knowledge of the matter. It is not in the Musnad of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: There is a narration from ibn abi Layla that he said the Prophet  said, &quot;The siddeequn (those who are truthful in their speech and are quick to accept the truth when it comes to them) are three: Habeeb the carpenter (the man who came from the farthest end of the town on Sura Ya-Seen); the believer in the Family of Pharaoh; and Ali, the best of them all.&quot; (Fabricated. As-Suyuti mentioned this in Al-Jami' As-Saghir 2/50, and Shaikh Nasir Ad-Deen Al-Albaani in Silsilat Al-Ahaadeeth Ad-Da'eefa, pg 358)<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This is a lie. It has been authentically narrated that the Prophet  described Abu Bakr  as being siddeeq (sing. of siddeequn). It has also been authenticated from the hadeeth of ibn Mas'ud, in a marfu' form, &quot;A man will keep on believing searching for the truth, until he is recorded with Allah as siddeeq.&quot; The siddeeqs are many according to this. Also, the Most High, said about Maryam that she was siddeeqa (Al-Maa'ida 57).<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: The Prophet  said, &quot;Close all doors (which lead directly into the masjid) except the door of Ali.&quot; (Fabricated. In its isnad is Abdullah bin Shuraik, and he is a liar. Ibn Hibban said, &quot;He was of extreme shiism, he narrated from the trustworthy people what they did not say.&quot; As-Suyuti said, &quot;Abdullah bin Shuraik is a liar.&quot; Ibnul Jawzi mentioned him in Al-Mawdu-at 1/363, As-Suyuti in Al-La-aali 1/346, Ash-Shawkani in Al-Fawa-id 361, and An-Nasaee in Khasaa-is 22)<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This is from the fabrications of the Shia. In Bukhari and Muslim, from the hadeeth of Abu Sa'eed Al-Khudri , the Prophet  during his final illness said, &quot;The person who was most giving to me in terms of his wealth and companionship was Abu Bakr. If I were to take a close friend, it would have been Abu Bakr, but what's between us is brotherhood and love in Islam. Let there be no dwelling connected to the masjid except that it be blocked, except for the dwelling of Abu Bakr&quot; (Muslim 7/108 and al-Bukhari 4/190-191). This was also authentically narrated from ibn Abbas.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: The Most High said, &quot;Today I have completed for you your religion,&quot; and Abu Nu'aim narrated through a chain which went through Abu Sa'eed, that the Prophet  called the people together in Ghadir Khum and lifted up Ali's hand until the Prophet's under-arm  was visible, and the people did not disperse until &quot;Today I have completed for you your religion&quot; was revealed. Then the Prophet  said, &quot;Allahu Akbar, Ali is the completion of the religion, and it pleased the Lord with me as a messenger and with Ali as a wali after me. O Allah be a wali to whoever takes Ali as a wali. Help whoever helps him, and be against whoever goes against him.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This is a lie, by agreement of the people who are familiar with lies. It is well established that the aya was revealed to Allah's messenger  when he was standing at Arafa, seven days before the day of Ghadir Khum.<br />
<br />
Then again, there is no allusion to Ali  nor to his imama in the aya. So your claim that the Qur'an points to that is clear falsehood. The proof for that would be in the hadeeth if it was correct.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: The Most High said, &quot;By the star when it goes down. Your companion has not gone astray nor has he erred&quot; (wannajmi idha hawa). The scholar, Ibn Al-Maghazi Ash-Shafi'ee narrated through a chain from ibn Abbas, that he said, &quot;I was sitting with a group of Bani Hashim with the Prophet  when a star started falling from the sky. So he  said, &quot;The one to whose house the star falls is the one who will be the leader after me.&quot; The star ended up in Ali's house. They said O Allah's messenger, &quot;Your love for Ali has made you err.&quot; So Allah, the Most High, revealed, &quot;By the star when it goes down.&quot; (Ibn Al-Jowzi listed it in Al-Mawdoo'aat 1/372-373. This hadeeth, no doubt, is a fabrication. How lackadaisical is the one who invented it. In its chain are many layers of darkness. First there is Abu Sali Badham, a liar, as well as Al-Kalbi and Muhamman bin Marwan As-Saddi. Al-Kalbi is the one blamed for this fabrication.&quot;)<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This, most obviously is a lie, and saying things about Allah without knowledge is forbidden, as He, the Most High, said, &quot;Don't relate what you have no knowledge of&quot; (Al-Israa', 36). Everyone who uses a hadeeth to prove a point, let him know its authenticity before he depends on it. If he uses it to prove something to someone else, let him clarify its authenticity. When it is known that there are lies present in books, then relying on something based on its presence in the book becomes similar to using the word of a man who may be truthful or a liar, to prove something. Also, if this had happened, there would have been no need for the events of Ghadir Khum.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Ahmad ibn Hanbal narrated that ibn Abbas said, &quot;There is never a place in the Qur'an, &quot;O you who believe,&quot; except that Ali is at its the first one intended and at its head.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: The reply: prove the authenticity of the narration. You claimed that Ahmad ibn Hanbal narrated it, but this is from the additions of Al-Qati'ee. He narrated it from Ibrahim bin Shuraik, from Zacharia bin Yahya Al-Kisaa'i, from Isa, from Ali bin Budhaima, from Ikrima, from Ibn Abbas. This was fabricated on the tongue of ibn Abbas, because Zacharia is not trustworthy. It is well established in authentic narrations that ibn Abbas used to say that Abu Bakr and Umar were better than Ali. This hadeeth if authentic, would not be a praise of Ali, because Allah said, &quot;O you who believe, why do you say what you do not do?&quot; (As-Saf 2). If Ali was the first one to be in the lime-light whenever Allah says &quot;O you who believe,&quot; then Allah has reprimanded him here.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: The Most High said, &quot;O Messenger, deliver what has been revealed to you&quot; (Al-Maa'ida). Everyone knows this was revealed about Ali. Abu Nu'aim relates through a chain from Atiyya, that it was revealed about Ali. This is also revealed in the Tafseer of Ath-Tha'labi. When it was revealed, the Messenger  took Ali's hand and said, &quot;Whoever's mawla I am, then Ali is his mawla.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Prophet  was the mawla of Abu Bakr and Umar and all the sahaba, therefore, Ali is their mawla, therefore, he is the imam... the leader.<br />
<br />
(Al-Hasan ibn Al-Hasan bin Ali bin Abi Talib was asked, &quot;Hadn't the messenger of Allah  said, &quot;Whoever's mawla I am, then Ali is his mawla&quot;? He said, &quot;Yes, but by Allah, the Messenger  did not intend by that the position of leadership and power. If he wanted that, he would have said it outright. Allah's messenger  was more straightforward and the best adviser to the Muslims, if he wanted to say this, he would have said, &quot;This is the one who will ********************ister your affairs and look after you after me, so listen to him and obey.&quot; By Allah, if Allah and His messenger had picked Ali, Allah would have facilitated his position for him. If Ali did not step up to that position, Ali would have been the first one to disobey Allah and His messenger&quot; [Al-Awaasim, pg 187])<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This is a lie greater than the previous lies. Your statement that the aya was revealed about Ali is false. No scholar says this. In the books of Abu Nu'aim, Ath-Tha'labi, and An-Naqqash, there are lies which can hardly be counted.<br />
<br />
Then we say to you... Do you accept everything people like An-Naqqash, Ath-Tha'labi and Abu Nu'aim write down, whether it is for you or against you? Or do you deny all of it? Or do you accept what fits your whims and reject what negates it?<br />
<br />
If they accept it unconditionally, then in those same books, then you'll find strong and weak narrations about the great position of the two shaikhs (Abu Bakr &amp; Umar). If they reject it all, then whatever proofs they rely on become baseless. If their way was to accept what fits their accepted beliefs, then the person can argue with them with what they reject and refute what they used as a proof, and let it be known that the thing about which people lied the most is the positions of people and their status.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: The Most High said, &quot;Your wali (friend/care taker) is Allah and His messenger and the believers who establish the salat, and they give the zakat and they prostrate&quot; (Al-Maaida 55). They all agree that this was revealed about Ali, because he gave a ring to a beggar while he was prostrating.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: When you say &quot;they agree that this was revealed about Ali,&quot; is a great false claim.  On the contrary, they all agree that it was not revealed about Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) in particular. Then we excuse this slip of yours, and ask you to produce just one sahih narration with its chain of narrators.<br />
<br />
If the intended meaning was that giving zakat while prostrating is a prerequisite to being a wali, then only Ali is to be considered a wali, neither Ali, nor Hasan (may Allah be pleased with them) would be included. On top of that, the statement, &quot;those who give the zakat,&quot; is a general term which does not point to one particular person. Also, a person is person is praised for doing something good, and giving zakat while in salat is not recommended even. If it was recommended, then the Prophet  would have done it, and he would have told others to do it, and Ali would have repeatedly don't it.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, it says, &quot;they give the zakat,&quot; so it points to the presence of zakat. However, Ali  never had zakat to give during the lifetime of the Prophet, because he was poor. In fact, Allah's statement is similar to His saying, &quot;Establish the salat, give the zakat, and prostrate with those who prostrate&quot; (Al-Baqara 43).<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: All the fiqh scholars refer to Ali and depend on his rulings.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This is a lie. For example, the four well known imams as well as others who are referred to in matters of fiqh, none of them have Ali as their reference source.<br />
<br />
As for Malik, then he takes his knowledge from the people of Madina, and the people of Madina almost never refer to Ali, but to Umar, Zaid, ibn Umar, and others (may Allah be pleased with them.<br />
<br />
As for Ash-Shafi'ee, he first studied under the people of Mecca, with those around ibn Juraih. Ibn Juraih studied under the students of ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father). Then Ash-Shafi'ee went on to Madina and studied under Malik. Then he advanced to Iraq and went his own way.<br />
<br />
As for Abu Hanifa, his main shaikh was Hammad bin Sulaiman, the student of Ibrahim An-Nakha'i, and Ibrahim wasthe student of Alqama, and Alqama was the student of ibn Mas'ud . Abu Hanifa also studied with Ataa and others in Mecca.<br />
<br />
As for Ahmad ibn Hanbal, then his school of thought was the same as that of the imams of hadeeth.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: The Malikis take their knowledge from Ali and his descendants.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: A lie. The Muwatta has only a small number of narrations from Ali and his descendants. Similarly the books containing the statements of the messenger and those containing statements of the companions, most of what they contain comes from other than the household.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Abu Hanifa studied under As-Saadiq.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: A lie. They lived in adjoining time periods, Ja'far died two years before Abu Hanifa. However, Abu Hanifa was born in the same year as Ja'far bin Muhammad. We don't know whether or not he studied under Ja'far or his father even one issue. He did study under people older people such as Ataa bin Abu Rabah and his original shaikh, Hammad bin Abu Sulaiman. Ja'far bin Muhammad at this time was in Madina.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Truly, Ash-Shafi'ee studied under Muhammad bin Al-Hasan.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: Ash-Shafi'ee did not meat him except after he was already a teacher. He sat with him, learned his methodology, debated with him, and wrote a refutation to him. In general, these people did not take from Ja'far neither branch issues nor foundation issues. However, they did narrate from him a small number of hadeeths.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: It is narrated that Malik studied under Rabi'a, and Rabi'a under Ikrima, who studied under Ali ibn Abbas, who was Ali's student.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This is a lie. Rabi'a did not study under Ikrima anything. Rather, he took from Sa'eed ibn Al-Musayyib, who used to refer his knowledge back to Umar, Zaid, and Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with them).<br />
<br />
Also, your claim that ibn Abbas was Ali's student is baseless, because he narrated very few hadeeths from him. He mostly studied under Umar and Zaid. He also used to give religious rulings based on what Abu Bakr and Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) said, and sometimes argued with Ali on some issues.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Allah, the Exalted, said, &quot;The borders of the two seas meat.&quot; The tafseer of Ath-Tha'labi, and of Abu Nu'aim, it is narrated that ibn Abbas said, this means Ali and Fatima. &quot;Between them is a barrier,&quot; means the Prophet  and, &quot;From them come pearl and gem,&quot; means Al-Hasan and Al-Husain. There is no such de************************ion about any of the other companions, therefore, Ali is most deserving of being the leader... the imam.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This is child's play, not tafseer of the Qur'an. It is from the fabrications of liars.  We can irrevocably prove that ibn Abbas  did not say that. First of all, the sura of Ar-Rahman, as everyone knows, was revealed in Mecca, and Ali Married Fatima (may Allah be pleased with them) in Madina. Then calling the two (Ali and Fatima) seas, another a pearl, the other coral, is not known from the Arabic language. We also know that the family of Ibrahim , such as Isma'eel and Is-haq, were better than Ali's family, so the verse does not prove that the people mentioned therein, if any, are better than the rest, who are not mentioned. In addition, Allah mentioned the two seas in another place, &quot;One of them is pure and sweet to drink, and the other salty and bitter, and He made a barrier between them&quot; (Al-Furqaan 53). So which of the two is salty and bitter according to you? Ali or Fatima? Then the statement, &quot;Between them is a barrier,&quot; implies that the barrier is there to stop one side from overtaking the other, and this is more of a negative characteristic than a positive one.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: How did Talha, Zubair and others allow themselves to take Aisha (wife of the Prophet ) with them to Iraq? How will they face Allah's messenger ? If one of us even talked to someone else's wife, or take her out of her house, or traveled with her anywhere, we would be considered that person's worst enemies.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This is from the self contradictions of the Rawafid. At times they hold Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) in high esteem in order to attack Talha and Zubair (may Allah be pleased with them). If you had any sense, then this would be considered a greater rebuke of Ali than these two. Talha and Zubair were in agreement with Aisha and followed her directions. The two and her were the farthest from lewdness or anything that resembled it. If it is logical for the Rafidi to say, &quot;How will they face Allah's messenger ... etc.,&quot; he may as well ask how those who fought against the wife of Allah's messenger  and sent his soldiers around her camel until they attacked it while she sat in the secluded box on the camel's back so that she became exposed to her enemies who went around her as slave maid... how will they face Allah's messenger.<br />
<br />
Clearly, this is a greater dishonor to a man's family than taking her out of her house while she was treated as a queen, well respected and honored, and nobody could approach her without her permission. Neither Talha nor Zubair (may Allah be pleased with them) or anyone else outside her close family members escorted her. In the camp, she had relatives such as Abdullah ibn Az-Zubair, the son of her sister, and staying alone with him is allowed according to the book and the sunna by consensus. Similarly, a woman can travel when such a person is present with her. She did not travel except with a mahram and the only person who extended his hand in her covered cart without her permission was Muhammad bin Abi Bakr, at which point she said, &quot;Whose hand is this? May Allah burn in with fire.&quot; He replied, &quot;Yes sister, in this world before the next.&quot; She said, &quot;In this world before the next.&quot; So it was that it burned in Egypt.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Truly, the Prophet  cursed Mu'awiya, the one who did not accept Islam except after the conquest of Mecca, son of one who did not accept Islam except after the conquest of Mecca, and he said, &quot;If you see him on my pulpit, kill him.&quot; The ahlus-Sunna call him &quot;scribe of revelation,&quot; while he did not write anything of revelation, he only wrote the Prophet's letters.<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This hadeeth you mentioned is weightless in the books of Islam. The scholars of hadeeth say it is a lie. Ibn Al-Jawzi mentions it in his collection of fabricated tales. Furthermore, people much worse than Mu'awiya (may Allah be pleased with him) have climbed the pulpit, and the Prophet  did not order his killing.<br />
<br />
As for your saying, &quot;The one who did not accept Islam except after the conquest of Mecca, son of one who did not accept Islam except after the conquest of Mecca,&quot; is not something for which a person is blamed for. Among those who accepted Islam after the conquest, there are many whose conversion has been exemplary, such as Al-Harith bin Hisham, Ikrima, Suhail, and Amr, Safwan bin Umayya, Hukaim bin Hizam, and others. They were among the best of Muslims. Mu'awiya  became among the best of Muslims and Umar appointed him as governor, and Umar was not one to be moved by personal sympathies, nor did he fear any rebuke for anything he did for Allah's sake.<br />
<br />
Ibn Mutahhir: Mu'awiya poisoned Al-Hasan. (ibn Al-Arabi said in Al-Awasim pg 214, this is impossible for two reasons: He had no quarrels with Al-Hasan; It is a secretive issue of which Allah only knows the truth, so how do they blame any particular person years after the incident without any trustworthy narration to that affect. Especially when these accusations come from people who have vain desires, and the people were in state of tribulation and affected by partisanship. Each side accusing the other of doing unbefitting things. Therefore, nothing but clear reports are accepted and nobody is heard except one who is fakir and safeguarded from these tribulations.)<br />
<br />
Ibn Taymiyya: This is an unconfirmed report. Some say is wife poisoned him. He was on the verge of a divorce , perhaps she poisoned him for that reason, and Allah knows best the truth behind the affairs. It was also said that her father, Al-Ash'ath bin Qais ordered that to be done. He used to be accused of secretly conspiring against Ali and his son, Al-Hasan (may Allah be pleased with both of them).<br />
<br />
If it is said that Mu'awiya  ordered her father, this would be pure speculation, and the Prophet  said, &quot;Beware of speculation, for the worst of false speech is speculation.&quot; In general, issues such as this are not judged by agreement of the Muslims. No action is taken, neither praise nor blame. Also, Al-Ash'ath bin Qays died on the year 40 (hijri).  He had died before the death of Al-Hasan by about 10 years, how could he order his daughter to do it? (just shows how many baseless statements are afloat).<br />

a Introduction: The current book contains some points chosen from Adh-Dhahabi's book, Al-Muntaqa, chosen by Muhammad Malallah of Ansaarus-Sunna Society on 9/15/1979, and translated by Elias Hassen in 1999. The reader should note that ibn Taymiyya and ibn Mutahhir were not contemporaries, but the current discourse is that of ideas, where ibn Mutahhir's statements are dissected and analyzed, so that the truth may be known.  I pray that Allah accept this effort, for he is the best of protectors and the best of helpers.  <br />

<br />
1 Note how a scholar is able to approach an issue from various angles.<br />
<br />
2 There is evidence which indicates that the 12th imam was never born, including testimony from family members.<br />
<br />
3 On the contrary, most of the sayings of the imams are simply cast upon them. The Shia are among the most ignorant groups about the Science of Rating narrators. It is enough for them that the narrator be a Shiite for his hadeeth to be accepted. Shaikh Yazeed bin Harun As-Sulami, one of Imam Ahmad's teachers said, &quot;the hadeeth of every man of bid'a is to be written, if he is not a caller to that, except the rafida, for they lie.&quot; Also, Shareek ibn Abdullah An-Nakha'i said, &quot;Take knowledge from everyone you meat, except the rafida. They forge hadeeth and take it as religion.&quot; It suffices you, dear reader, that Al-Kulayni's, Al-Kafi, the most authentic book of hadeeth for the Shiites has 9916 weak hadeeths as mentioned by Hasan As-Sadr in Ta'sees Ash-Shi'a, pg 88.ourse:</div></div><hr />
