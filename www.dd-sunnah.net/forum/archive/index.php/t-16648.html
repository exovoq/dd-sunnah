<br />
Any comments?</div></div><hr />

<br />
He was nowhere other than being at home with her, n yep he did nothing<br />
Actually he was in need of help himself, 'cuz according to their myth, the companions placed a rope around his neck n dragged him all the way to Abu Bakr to give his pledge of Alliance. Ain't that funny now? hehehehe</div></div><hr />

So true that the radfidhah have no sound logic, nor knowledge of texts, they believe something then start lying to prove what they already believe in instead of following texts. THEN adjusting their beliefs according to the texts.<br />
The Shiekh of Islam was so right about them when he said &quot;Subhan the one who created lying and gave 9/10 of it to the shias!&quot;  and they are still the same! Lying is in their blood!</div></div><hr />
