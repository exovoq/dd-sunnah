<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StraightPath</div><div class="date">28-07-03, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imaam ash-Shaafiíee said, ìThat a person is put to trial with everything that Allaah has forbidden, besides Shirk, is better than that he looks at Kalaam (theological rhetoric).î He also said, ìIf people knew what (misleading and destructive) desires are contained within theological rhetoric they would certainly flee from it as they would from a lion,î he also said, ìWhoever showed boldness in approaching  theological rhetoric will never prosper. Reported by Ibn Qudaamah in his Burhaan fee Bayaanil-Quríaan.<br />
<br />
ìMy ruling regarding the people of theological rhetoric is that they should be beaten with palm leaves and shoes and be paraded amongst the kinsfolk and the tribes with it being announced, ëThis is the reward of the one who abandons the Book and the Sunnah and turns to theological rhetoric (kalaam).î Sharh ëAqeedatit-Tahaawiyyah of lbn Abil-íIzz, p. 75. <br />
<br />
Ibn ëAbdul-Barr reported with his chain of narration from the scholars of the Maalikees in the east, that ibn Khuzaimah said in the book of witnesses Kitaabus-Shuhudaat) in explanation of the saying of Maalik that it is not permissible to accept the witness of the people of Innovator and innovated sects, ìThe people of the innovated sects in the view of Maalik and the rest of our companions are the people of theological rhetoric (Kalaam). So every person of theological rhetoric is from the people of the innovated sects and innovation, whether he is an Ashíaree, or other than an Ashíaree, and his witness is not accepted in Islaam ever. Indeed he is to be ostracized, and punished for his innovation and if he persists in it, and repentance is to be sought from him. îíAlso ibn ëAbdul-Barr himself again reports in Al-Ihtiqaa from the three scholars: Maalik, Aboo Haneefah and ash-Shaafiíee that they forbade theological rhetoric and spoke severely against its people, and that they are innovators and are to be punished. Its like is reported by Ibnul-Qayyim in Ijtimaaíul-Juyooshil- Islaamiyyah - and what are the Ashíariyyah except people of theological rhetoric?<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Ibn ëAbdul-Barr said, ìThe people of Fiqh and Aathaar in all the various towns and cities are agreed unanimously that the Ahlul-Kalaam (People of Theological Rhetoric) are (but) Ahlul-Bidaí waz-Zaigh (the People of  Innovations and Deviation). And they are not considered, by all of the above, to be amongst the ranks of the Scholars (in truth).î Reported by Ibn Qudaamah in his Burhaan fee Bayaanil-Quríaan.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aboo Yoosuf, the companion of Aboo Haneefah said, ìWhoever sought knowledge by kalaam (theological rhetoric) will turn a heretical apostate,î and Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 241H) said, ìThe person of theological rhetoric will never prosper. And never do you see anyone looking into theological rhetoric except that in his heart is a desire for creating mischief.î Both narrations are reported by Ibn Qudaamah in his Burhaan fee Bayaanil-Quríaan.<br />
One of the KNOWN people of rhetoric who created a sect is Abdullaah ibn Saeed Ibn Kullaab, al-Qattaan, al-Basree, the head of the mutakallimoon (people of theological rhetoric) of Basrah in his time. He is also the author of works in refutation of the Muítazilla but he sometimes agreed with them. He died some time after 240H, As- Siyar, 11/74.<br />
<br />
And the shiekh of Islam Ibn Taymiyah said, ìAs for al- Haarith al-Muhaasibee, then he used to ascribe himself to the saying of Ibn Kullaab, therefore Ahmad (ibn Hanhal) ordered that he be deserted, and Ahmad used to warn against Ibn Kullaab and his followers.î Dar at-Taíaarudil ëAql wan-Naql, 2/6.</div></div><hr />
