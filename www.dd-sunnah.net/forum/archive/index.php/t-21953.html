I saw most Islamic sites, which talk about sunnis and shi'ites tell us that Islam divided into two sunnis people and shi'its people, but the truthe there r differences between us and them, Shi'ism is a separate religion &amp; cannot be associated with Islam<br />
<br />
here are the differences<br />

<br />
Especially in foriegn countries because they think that Sunna and Shia similar to each other but absolutely they don't ..I have read in New Zealand Atlas that Shia in Saudia Arabia situated around 15% but I think that's quite big....</div></div><hr />

<br />
every time I come across a story of people converted to Islam, I thank god they found the right path, Real Islam, the Islam we know &amp; not the shi3i way as the shi3i way will only tell them to worship 12 gods (or maybe more) instead of three!!<br />
<br />
Mr. Ashraf,<br />
Man I think u need a better glasses!! I don't think u r seeing the full picture here,<br />
What is terrorism any way!!  <br />
<br />
For every ACTION there is a REACTION!! A famous logic people like you should consider!!</div></div><hr />

But some of the shiahs are muslims, those who do not curse the sahabah, I think they follow the marja of ayatollah fadlallah<br />
<br />
Wa Salam, may allah guide them to the truth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">«·ÕÃ«Ã</div><div class="date">18-05-07, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is not just the matter of cursing, slamdering &amp; belittling the Companions that cause them to be disbelievers. Nor the issue is a dispute over a jusrisprudential matters. This we can live with w/o a doubt. Rather, the issue is over our differences in the basics, principles &amp; fundamentals of faith. As such, even those who follow the Lebanese &quot;Reference&quot; are out of the fold of Islam, period</div></div><hr />

How can we know if they are saying the truth or they are hiding behind what they call 'Taqiyah' to avoid troubles. Fadlalah has the same belief as other extremists,  I mean the basics and principles . The only thing is that Shiaa in Lebanon or abroad  must behave to people as civilized and moderate, and call for peace or dialogue, but in other places like Iraq and India etc...we can see their reality....Still we can consider Fadlalah as someone who maybe he can soften the savage thinking of his immitators.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know shiahs who dont believe in such, should they also be called kaffirs?, what if nearly most of the arab shiahs are Juhala2.</div></div><hr />
