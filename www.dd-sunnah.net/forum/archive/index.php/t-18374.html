i am a new member to the Forum<br />
I am 19 years old<br />
I used to live in the United Arab Emirates&lt;, Now i am living in Canada<br />
I am Sunni<br />
the problem is that when i was there in school they didn't teach us about the shi'tes and the wahabi and the sofi and so on<br />
so if you guys don't mind can you please tell me what they are and where i can find the differences between them and Sunnah<br />
i have been reading but i only find small stuff that in reallity makes no <br />
sense to me and i don't know how people believe it <br />
Like i wanna know about the Ismailies , the 3alawes all those sects and stuff because i know little little stuff about them<br />
i wanna learn about them so that i can defend my self from them and from their Fitan<br />
<br />
thank you<br />

If you went to school there, does that mean you can read Arabic? Or did you go to an English school? If you know Arabic theres tons of information on the Arabic board.<br />
<br />
Anyhow as for &quot;Wahabi&quot; there is no such thing as a Wahabi, the graveworshippers from Sufis and Shias say that Shiekh Muhammad Bin AbdulWahab introduced new things to the religion, because he said say Ya Allah and not Ya Jilani or Ya Ali and said we should understand the sunnah, the way the salaf ( pious predecessors ) understood it without introducing new concepts that they didnt have.<br />
<br />
 It is impossible for one to say I understand the sunnah better than the companions or any of the Imams of the first three generations of Islam.<br />
As the prophet pbuh said the best generation is mine, then the one after it then the one after it.<br />
<br />
He also said the Jews will be divided into 71 sects, the Christians into 72 and the Muslims into 73, all are in hell except for one, they asked who? He said the ones that are on what I am upon today me and my companions.<br />
<br />
Both hadeeths are authentic.<br />
<br />
The pious predecessors are known as the salaf, thats where the word &quot;Salafee&quot; came from, its saying we are sunni, but because some sufis and others claim to be sunni we use the term Salafee to distinguish ourselves from them. <br />
<br />
So our names would bePeople of the Sunnah ( Ahl Al Sunnah ), People of Hadeeth ( Ahl Al Hadeeth ) and Salafees, all of these refer to basic concepts in beliefs , especially the basic creed. So the bottom line is not in the  name but in what is named ( meaning the beliefs themselves )<br />
<br />
All what Shiekh Muhammad Bin AbdulWahab called for is simple pure Islam and they didnt want to leave the ways of their fathers and ancestors.<br />
<br />
So the term wahabi is only a form of name calling by graveworshippers, nothing more.<br />
<br />
If you have specific questions that would be absoloutly great,please dont hesitate to ask, but general questions are hard to answer because theres so much to cover.<br />
 Welcome to the board bro :)</div></div><hr />

As for the shias,, therse plenty of info in both Arabic and English, if they deny this, show them whats in their books, let them see the debates of al Mustaqillah, let them read whats in their books, if they deny it they are on of two , they are either liars and practicing Taqiyyah, or they are absoloutly ignorant of their own religion.<br />
<br />
What sunnah is it that they follow bro? their &quot;Bukhari&quot; is known as Al Kafee, which is basically a group of hadeeths that are lies and not really hadeeths, no chains of narrators, no science of hadeeth involved when it comes to authenticating or weakening a hadeeth.<br />
<br />
Its up to the mood of the scholar they are talking to. You saw probably on al Mustaqillah debate how their scholars couldnt even give the definition of Saheeh Hadeeths.<br />
<br />
Their chains contain things like &quot; I heard from a friend&quot;. or something similar.. how is this authentic, examples are in the Arabic section.<br />
<br />
How can they claim to follow the sunnah if this is the case. Ask them why they dont believe in Bukhari Hadeeths that are not in their books and stress on the not in their books part because they are liars and like to play with words and if you didnt add that part they would say &quot; Oh we believe in many of them&quot;<br />
While in Reality they dont rely on al Bukhari because hes a kaafir in their eyes and so are the people in the chains of narrators, as their scholars said all of the companions are kaafir except for three!<br />
<br />
In summary, show them sayings of their scholars that are kufr, such as the Quran is corrupt or the Imams know the future and know when they will die and only die when they chose to do so, saying the companions are kaafir, saying Aisha raa was not innocent in the ifk story and many other kufr beliefs.<br />
If they say oh they are wrong , then this destorys the basis of their religion as it requires that they call their scholars kaafir, so ask them if they consider them so or not.<br />
If they say yes this is correct then it will show you how they lie and do not follow the sunnah.<br />
They will have no way out. They only have two choices, saying their scholars are kafir which makes their religion lose all credability, or they would accept or go around in circles.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for Ismaelees they are kuffar by agreement of all Muslims, their philosophical ways and new beliefs taught by their &quot;Aga Khan&quot; about Quran and its place in life and so on, went way too far from Islam.<br />
<br />
Insha'Allah I will post the beliefs of Ismae'lees in both Arabic and English ( different articles ) so you can take a look wassalam</div></div><hr />

Actually there's nothin I can add to what you've mentioned other than askin our brother Boshnaq to be aware of these folks who are artful and masters of deceptions. It is not adviseable, however; to argue with these people unless the person's creed is well founded and has a fair knowledge of their creed. x<br />
<br />
I ask the brother to frequently follow up with the arabic section of this forum to gain the knowledge that will aid him to face followers of all cults such as Ismai'ilies, Ja'faries, and what have you. x<br />
<br />
Jazaakumullah khairan</div></div><hr />

Jazak Allah khair bro Al Hajjaj thats so imporant, one must learn his own creed properly so he can be able to compare and have a dialogue..... these forums are very good insha'Allah for a start</div></div><hr />

I thought they were 12 imamer shias, as for Isma'elees theres not even a disagreement among scholars on their kufr, their &quot;Aga Khan&quot;s daughter is married to a Christian and hes their billionare religious leader, it just shows you how they are fundementally different from Muslims.</div></div><hr />
