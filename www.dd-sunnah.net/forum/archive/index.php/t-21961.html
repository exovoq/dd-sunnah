<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StraightPath</div><div class="date">24-10-03, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assalamu alaikom warahmat Allahi wabarakatoh,<br />
<br />
All grace to Allah, we thank Him, and seek help ( only ) from Him, and seek refuge to Allah from the evils of our souls and the bad deeds.<br />
He who is guided by Allah, cannot be misguided, and he who is misguided by Allah swt, nobody can guide.<br />
<br />
I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except for Allah swt, and I bear witness that Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him and his family and companions, is the slave of Allah, and His messenger.<br />
<br />
Insha'Allah as we heard this English section will be updated to make it easier for English speakers to browse and participate on this site, and insha'Allah benefit from it.<br />
<br />
There are a few points that I remind you and myself of , before the add campaign.<br />
<br />
1- Remember your goal of being here, which is insha'allah, to please Allah swt, and give successful da'wah.<br />
<br />
2-Remember that the goal of da'wah is to have people learn and benefit. Learning can happen when people read posts and texts, however, the way the text is presented would affect the level of acceptance of any information given.<br />
<br />
Invite (mankind, O Muhammad SAW) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Isl‚m) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Inspiration and the Qur'‚n) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better. Truly, your Lord knows best who has gone astray from His Path, and He is the Best Aware of those who are guided. (An-Nahl 16:125)<br />
<br />
3- Keep in mind- and I know this from experience- that MANY of the English speaking Muslims, especially reverts, do not know many things about Islam. <br />
<br />
When shias for example say no we do not worship graves,in a nice sweet manner, they believe them. They do not know shia and sufi practices in our Muslim countries that many of us are familiar with and the shias and sufis would not tell them about it.<br />
Keep in mind that many people have not seen what you have seen them doing/saying, and that Muslims have different backgrounds and educational levels.<br />
<br />
Explaining these issues, will take wisdom, and patience.<br />
<br />
4- BE PATIENT, and again, keep in mind that the goal isnt only &quot;iqamat al hujjah&quot; ( establishing evidence against them ), but the goal is have them accept it. This requires patience and well presented thoughts in a polite manner. ( Bil Husna )<br />
<br />
5- People sometimes tend to take things to extremes, some would try to be nice and show supposed tolerance , by changing Islam for others, as if that would make them accept.<br />
<br />
 Others would have the approach of &quot;this is Islam, take it or leave it&quot;. <br />
<br />
The correct way is without Ifraat or Tafreet , in other words, without taking it to any of the extremes remembering that we, ahl al sunnah, are always in the middle path. We have tolerance, yet we do not compramise the one truth. <br />
<br />
We wont have our religion &quot;melted&quot; in the name of being nice and understanding, and at the same time, we wont be too firm and not being nice and polite in the name of not compramising their religion. Its all about choices of words, and what is implied by them.<br />
<br />
If one does what he can to teach, considering the phsycological aspects of the da'wah. NOT compramising Islam, yet presenting it in a patient manner,then he has done what he can on his part.<br />
<br />
6- Sufis are known to have sweet tongues, and in their dawah they reply on emotions only. They compramise Islamic rulings &quot;Al-Ahkaam&quot; just to gain followers and the shias -needless to say-, lie.<br />
<br />
As followers of the Sunnah on the way of the salaf, our task is the hardest, as we cannot compramise our religion, and at the same time, when teaching it to people from various backgrounds, it needs great patience. <br />
<br />
So we have two burdens, burden of teaching and conveying the message with no compramise, and the burden of being patient. Insha'Allah there will be a great reward for that.<br />
<br />
7- In the US and many other English speaking countries, many young Salafee brothers have taken a negative way in giving da'wah. Many have indulged new Muslims into very deep issues that they do not understand, and cannot understand without MUCH studying and time.<br />
<br />
They have done this especially when crticizing individuals who have went astray , either generally or in some specific issues, leaving those new to the religion confused thinking that they are only seeing negative things because some brothers gave da'wah in a way that is usually given to people who have good knowledge and Islamic background.<br />
<br />
Of course, this is due to lack of knowledge. The result however, is a division. Some people learned a lot and understood. Others were left confused with a negative impression, which again, is due to lack of knowledge in general.<br />
This, when giving da'wah, must be dealt with in a polite calm manner to correct misunderstandings that some of these people have.<br />
Iif one has not known the three kinds of tawheed for example, when it is said to them this person has stated that Allah is everywhere ( ie not above His throne ), therefore he is a deviant. They will not understand that, and they will be thinking &quot;so what?&quot;<br />
<br />
So the bottom line of this point is A- Deal with each person in a way he will understand, knowing not all people have the same amount of knowledge, this ( again ) requires patience and wisdom.<br />
<br />
8- Aviod lowering ones self in replying to people who are stubburn, ignorant, or both by saying things such as &quot;You are ignorant&quot; , or &quot;You are stupid&quot;. <br />
<br />
As long as one has the truth supported by authentic evidences, one can deliver the message, present the facts, and let people learn and judge for themselves, and see whos the one presenting evidences, and whos the one who can only reply with insults. There is no way that is convincing more than that.<br />
<br />
9- Remember to be fair:- <br />
Remember to be fair and give credit when credit is due no matter how heated the discussion gets. This is the way of ahl al sunnah wal jama'ah.<br />
For example if someone says:<br />
<br />
We cannot limit Allah swt to a place, this is why we sufis who follow the ash'aree aqeedah, say that Allah swt is everywhere.<br />
<br />
One could reply in two ways :<br />
1- You sufis are kafir for saying that Allah is everywhere, then quote Sufis like Ibn Arabi.<br />
2- Alhamdulillah, we agree that Allah swt cannot be limited in a place, because a place is a creation and we cannot say that he is IN His creation. ( give credit for that )<br />
<br />
 Then explain the difference between the kufr beliefs of Ibn Arabi and then explain ash'aree belief in this issue and why it is wrong.<br />
<br />
 Then explain our position and why we hold it.<br />
<br />
The result indeed, will be different from two replies saying the same thing, and truth would not be compramised.<br />
<br />
10- If a person combined ignorance and stubborness, either ignore or say good. No need to return insults.<br />
<br />
Allah swt said to Moses peace and blessings pbuh <br />
&quot;Go, both of you, to Fir'aun (Pharaoh), verily, he has transgressed (all bounds in disbelief and disobedience and behaved as an arrogant and as a tyrant). And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept admonition or fear All‚h.&quot; (Ta-Ha 20:43-44)<br />
<br />
&quot;....and let not the hatred of some people in (once) stopping you from Al_Masjid_al_Har‚m (at Makkah) lead you to transgression (and hostility on your part). Help you one another in Al_Birr and At_Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear All‚h. Verily, All‚h is Severe in punishment. (Al-Ma'idah 5:2)<br />
<br />
11 - If a person insults Muslims of any nationality, do NOT get angry and reply by insulting another Muslim nation and remember that Allah swt said:<br />
<br />
 O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you with All‚h is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa [i.e. one of the Muttaq˚n (pious - see V.2:2). Verily, All‚h is All-Knowing, All-Aware. (Al-Hujurat 49:13)<br />
<br />
12- Aviod saying things that have come into our communities that are not correct, when speaking to non Muslims, such as saying things like &quot; I respect your religion and you respect mine&quot;<br />
<br />
This is not correct, if you believe their religion is falsehood, it means you do not respect it. Saying so would mean you would either be lying, or respecting falsehood forgetting a major aqeedah concept which is Al Wala Wal Bara ( Loyalty and Disassociation )<br />
<br />
The correct manner to say what is usually intended by this phrase is &quot;You have chosen a religion that you believe is true, and we believe is falsehood, and we have chosen a religion that we believe is truth and you consider falsehood. We can insult eachother, or we can keep insults aside and have a dialogue about certain facts. We Muslims would choose the second choice. <br />
<br />
Allah swt said in His holy book :<br />
And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides All‚h, lest they insult All‚h wrongfully without knowledge. Thus We have made fair_seeming to each people its own doings; then to their Lord is their return and He shall then inform them of all that they used to do. (Al-An'am 6:108)<br />
<br />
13- We are all human and make mistakes and forget or sometimes mix between two hadeeths for example.<br />
If one makes a mistake in a discussion, do NOT be too proud to admit it fearing it will be a &quot;point&quot; against you held by the other party. <br />
Admiting mistakes will only strengthen your position as if your position is correct, a &quot;human&quot; mistake cannot make your points and evidences forgotten.<br />
<br />
14- Use Allah swt said and His messenger pbuh said as much as possible to aviod turning the discussion into a game of words.<br />
<br />
15 - When discussing, focus on the ideas presented by the person you are discussing with, not the person himself. This is sufficiant to achieve your goal when doing da'wah.<br />
<br />
16- Do not let anyone with extreme positions lead you to take the other extreme when being against his thoughts.<br />
 For example, if a person presents ideas of the mutazilah regarding the attributes of Allah swt denying them, do not let that make you take a position of the ones who liken Allah swt to His creation.<br />
If someone is from the Khawarij, do not let this make you use ideas of the Murji'ah to refute or vice versa.<br />
<br />
In summary, stay focused on Quran and Sunnah with the understanding of the salaf ( Pious Predecessors ) and do not let anything  in any discussion effect you, be focused.<br />
<br />
17- If you do not know how to respond to something, dont. Do not ever speak without knowledge, even if your position is correct. Leave it to those who know.<br />
<br />
May Allah consider us all one of those who helped keep his religion perserved from corruption as it has happened with other nations.<br />
<br />
Whatever I have said that is correct is from Allah swt, and whatever I said that was wrong is from the shaytan ( Satan )<br />
