&quot;The Bible - Humbug and Horror&quot; <br />
<br />
by Michael Glass<br />
<br />
&quot;Anti-Semitism&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
One measure of the ill-feeling that was felt by early Christians towards Judaism of that time is to list texts in the New Testament that accuse Jews or the Jewish religious leaders of violent intentions or physical violence against Jesus or his followers: <br />
<br />
Matthew 12:9-14, 16:21, 20:17-19, 21:33-46, 26:1-5, 14-16, 47-50, 26:57, 66, 27:1-2, 19-26. <br />
<br />
Mark 3:1-6, 8:31, 10:33-34, 12:1-12, 14:1-2, 10-11, 43-49, 64, 15:1, 8-15. <br />
<br />
Luke 9:22, 20:9-26, 22:1-6, 52-53, 22:26, 23:5, 23:13-25. <br />
<br />
John 5:15-18, 7:1, 10-13, 19-20, 28-34, 8:20, 37-40, 57-59, 10:30-39, 11:45-57, 12:9-11, 18:3-14, 19-24, 28-32, 19:6-7, 12-16. Acts 2:22-23, 3:13, 4:22, 5:17-42, 6:8-15, 7:50-60, 8:1-3, 9:1-2, 9:21, 13:28-29, 50, 14:1-6, 19, 17:5-9, 20:19, 21:11, 22:22-23, 23:2-3, 10, 12-15, 20-21, 27, 24:1-9. <br />
<br />
2 Corinthians 11:24. <br />
<br />
I Thessalonians 2:15-15. <br />
<br />
Jesus made scathing attacks on the Jewish religious leaders of his day and their teachings. (Matthew 15:12-14, 16:5-12, 21:12-13, and chapter 23, Mark 11:15-17, 12:38-40, Luke 12:1-3, 16:14-15). His condemnation of those who rejected his message was savage. (Matthew 10:11-15, 11:20-24, Luke 10:13-15). One of the earliest controversies in the church was whether circumcision and Old Testament food taboos applied to non-Jewish converts to Christianity. (Acts 15, 21:17-26, Galatians 2:3-6). One of Paul's letters warns about &quot;unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially those of the circumcision: whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake&quot;. (Titus 1:10-11). <br />
<br />
The Acts of the Apostles shows how much the early Christian missionaries depended on the synagogues to preach and reach potential converts. (Acts 13:14-16, 14:1, 17:1-4, 18:1-4). Indeed in Rome, the Jewish leaders visited him when he came there as a prisoner (Acts 28:16-17, 21-25), and seemed to give him a very fair hearing. <br />
<br />
In the Book of Revelations, however, feelings against the Jews were much nastier: <br />
<br />
...I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. Revelation 2:9. <br />
<br />
Behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. Revelation 3:9. <br />
<br />
Add to this the de************************ion of Paul: <br />
<br />
...the Jews; who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men: forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost. I Thessalonians 2:14-16. <br />
<br />
Which echo the words of Jesus himself about the Jewish Scribes and pharisees: <br />
<br />
Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes ... that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias ... All these things shall come upon this generation. Matthew 23:34-36. <br />
<br />
And to the lawyers: <br />
<br />
Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres. Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute: that the blood of all the prophets, which shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation ... verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation. Luke 11:47-50, 51. <br />
<br />
Finally, top that off with the words attributed to the crowd just before Jesus' crucifixion: <br />
<br />
Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children. Matthew 27:25. <br />
<br />
The horror and suffering that came upon innocent people because of these verses almost defies de************************ion. And no wonder. Jesus himself is quoted as saying that all the righteous blood that was ever shed shall come upon these Jews! <br />
<br />
Thomas Paine said of the Bible: <br />
<br />
...it would be more consistent that we call it the word of a demon than the word of God. It is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind <br />
<br />
Certainly that judgment applies to these verses, at least. <br />
<br />
Of course there's another side to it in the Bible. Paul warns Gentile believers not to be boastful because some of the original branches of the olive tree (the Jews) had been broken off to graft them in: <br />
<br />
For it thou wert cut out of the olive tree which wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree? Romans 11:24. <br />
<br />
And Jesus himself said to the Samaritan woman, &quot;Salvation is of the Jews.&quot; (John 4:22). <br />
<br />
But the evidence goes further than this. Matthew's gospel records an incident where a Gentile woman begged him to save her daughter from being possessed by a devil... <br />
<br />
...But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs. And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table. Matthew 15:23-27. <br />
<br />
Only when the woman likened herself to a dog snatching crumbs did Jesus relent. Matthew 15:28, (also Mark 7:24-30). <br />
<br />
No-one else in the gospels had to struggle in this way to get Jesus to relieve human suffering, but with one exception, all the others appear to be Jewish. The exception was judged 'worthy' as he loved the Jews and had built a synagogue for them. (Luke 7:4-5). Despite comments of the like of Matthew 8:10-12, perhaps Jesus' fundamental attitude towards the Gentiles was to be summed up in the Sermon on the Mount: <br />
<br />
Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you. Matthew 7:6.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Islam doesn&#8217;t allow using war to force others to be Muslims God said in the Holy Quran <br />
<br />
002.256 <br />
YUSUFALI: Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth all things. <br />
PICKTHAL: There is no compulsion in religion. The right direction is henceforth distinct from error. And he who rejecteth false deities and believeth in Allah hath grasped a firm handhold which will never break. Allah is Hearer, Knower. <br />
<br />
Muslims are allowed to fight others in the following cases:<br />
1- if others attack Muslims, they must fight in self-defense.<br />
2-If Muslims are driven out of their homeland, they must fight those who drove them out of their land and must restore their land.<br />
Islam does not like aggression whether done by Muslims or by non-Muslims, whether done by individuals or by states. Islam does not allow Muslims to declare War against a peaceful non-Muslim neighbor.<br />
But Islam urges Muslims to go to War in self-defense and especially when some Muslims are driven out of their homeland.<br />
As in the case of people of Palestine, who were driven out by the Israelis in 1948 and 1967.<br />
<br />
WHAT DOES ISLAM SAY ABOUT WAR?<br />
Like Christianity, Islam permits fighting in self-defense, in defense of religion, or on the part of those who have been expelled forcibly from their homes. It lays down strict rules of combat, which include prohibitions against harming civilians and against destroying crops, trees and livestock. As Muslims see it, injustice would be triumphant in the world if good men were not prepared to risk their lives in a righteous cause. The Qur'an says: <br />
<br />
&quot;Fight in the cause of God against those who fight you, but do not transgress limits. God does not love transgressors.&quot; (2:190) <br />
<br />
If they seek peace, then seek you peace. And trust in God for He is the One that heareth and knoweth all things. (8:61) <br />
<br />
War, therefore, is the last resort, and is subject to the rigorous conditions laid down by the sacred law. The term Jihad literally means 'struggle', and Muslims believe that there are two kinds of Jihad. The other 'Jihad' is the inner struggle, which everyone wages against egotistic desires, for the sake of attaining inner peace. <br />
<br />
Many Christians are praised several times in the Qur'an<br />
<br />

<br />
=============<br />
<br />
In the case of Christianity what should this tell us <br />
<br />
<br />
Who committed crimes against civilian and wage wars and use discrimination and genocide against the humanity? <br />
Some examples:<br />
<br />
1- Inquisition against Muslims and Jews The Inquisition begins as Pope Gregory IX assigns Dominicans responsibility for combating heresy. Torture used (1252). Ferdinand and Isabella establish Spanish Inquisition (1478). Tourquemada, Grand Inquisitor, forces conversion or expulsion of Spanish Jews (1492). Forced conversion of Moors (1499). Inquisition in Portugal (1531). First Protestants burned at the stake in Spain (1543). Spanish Inquisition abolished (1834).<br />
<br />
2- Crusade against Muslims Jews and Christian orthodox In 1095 at Council of Clermont, Pope Urban II calls for war to rescue Holy Land from Muslim infidels. The First Crusade (1096) is assembled in response to Emperor Alexius I. The Christians capture Antioch (1098) and Jerusalem (1099). They establish the Crusader States, ruled by Europeans. It is the only successful crusade. The Second Crusade begins after the Seljuk Turks recapture Edessa, one of the Crusader States, in 1144. It is led by King Louis VIII of France and Holy Roman Emperor Conrad III. Crusaders perish in Asia Minor (1147).<br />
<br />
3- The Albigensian Crusade (so named, because the French city of Albi was a Cathar stronghold), lasted for 20 years, from 1209 to 1229. While authorized by the pope, the actual fighting was carried out primarily by secular forces, especially under Simon de Montfort. The suppression of the Cathar heresy established new &quot;standards&quot; for ferocity for the Roman Church in dealing with its own flock. Perhaps the most famous example was on July 22, 1209, when the city of Beziers was sacked, with over 20,000 men, women and children killed by crusaders. The event will forever be framed in history by the words of papal legate Arnaud, whom, when asked if Catholics should be spared during the assault, answered &quot;Kill them all, for God knows His own&quot;.<br />
<br />
4 - 1202 Pope Innocent III launches fourth Crusade to defeat Egypt. After some setbacks, Crusaders defy the pope and sack Constantinople, center of the Orthodox church. A three-day massacre by the Crusaders alienates the eastern and western churches for centuries.<br />
<br />
5- WWI waged by Christian and the dead by million<br />
<br />
<br />
6 - WWII waged by Christians and the dead by million<br />
<br />
7- America attacked japan and used two atomic <br />
bombs <br />
<br />
against Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br />
<br />
Death toll of Japanese civillian <br />
Hiroshima 118,661 <br />
Nagasaki 73,884<br />
<br />
Hiroshima Injuries 79,130 <br />
Nagasaki Injuries 74,909<br />
<br />
8- America used chemical weapon against Korea and Vietnam during war as (agent orange). And the victims was thousands of civilian.<br />
<br />
9- Discrimination based on color and race .<br />
<br />
10- Black cannot ride bus with whites May 4, 1961 -- Thirteen &quot;Freedom Riders&quot; begin bus trip through the South to test compliance with laws banning segregation in interstate transportation. Black and White riders were bombed and savagely beaten, but their movement <br />
ended segregation interstate transportation facilities.<br />
<br />
11- white Christian used apartheid against South African people<br />
<br />
12- Racial Nazi Hitler and fascist Mussolini<br />
<br />
13 - White supremacy and racial groups like KKK and its racial crime<br />
<br />
14- Tulsa massacre against African American <br />
<br />
15- Genocide against native American<br />
<br />
16- Slave trade <br />
<br />
This is only some example of crimes committed <br />
against humanity committed by Christians.<br />

Hosea 9:11-16 Hosea prays for God's intervention. &quot;As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception. Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them! Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer. Give them, O Lord: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts...Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb.&quot; <br />

1Corinthians 6:9-10 &quot;Do you now know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral, nor the idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers will inherit the kingdom of God.&quot; <br />
2Samuel 11:2-4 &quot;...And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?

CANNIBALISM<br />
Matthew 26:26 &quot;And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.&quot; <br />
2Kings 6:28,29 &quot;And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.

Numbers 15:30-31 &quot;Any person who sins deliberately, whether he is a native or a foreigner, is guilty of treating the Lord with contempt, and he shall be be put to death, because he has rejected what teh Lord said and has deliberately broken one of his commands. He is responsible for his own death.&quot; <br />
Numbers 15:32-36 &quot;Once, while the Israelites were still in the wilderness, a man was found gathering firewood on the Sabbath. He was taken to Moses, Aaron and the whole community, and was put under guard, because it was not clear what should be done with him. Then the Lord said to Moses, &quot;The man must be put to death; the whole community is to stone him to death outside the camp.&quot; So the whole community took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the Lord had commanded.&quot; <br />
<br />
CASTRATION<br />
Matthew 19:12 &quot;For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.&quot; <br />

CHILD MURDER, INFANTICIDE <br />
Exodus 4:22-23 &quot;Then you must tell him that I, the Lord, say, 'Israel is my first born son. I told you to let my son go, so that he might worship me, but you refused. Now I am going to kill your first-born son.'&quot; <br />
Numbers 31:17 (Moses) &quot;Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every women that hath known man by lying with him (in other words: women that might be pregnant).&quot; <br />
1Samuel 15:1-8 &quot;Now listen to what the Lord Almighty says. He is going to punish the people of Amalek because their ancestors opposed the Israelites... 3-8 : With 210000 soldiers they killed all the men, women, children, babies, cattle, camels and donkeys.&quot; <br />
2Samuel 12:11-19 &quot;Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee ... the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die. ...

DIVORCE<br />
Matthew 5:31,32 &quot;But I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.&quot; <br />

Revelation 4th Seal and 6th Seal. Here's a quick calculation assuming an initial population of 6 000 000 000: <br />
1/4 are killed when the 4th seal is opened: 1/4 of 6.0 billion is 1.5 billion, leaving 4.5 billion survivors. <br />
1/3 are killed then the 6th seal is opened: 1/3 of 4.5 billion is 1.5 billion, leaving 3.0 billion survivors. <br />
Exactly half of Humankind are killed, and this calculation is only using TWO of the seven seals! <br />

<br />
UNFORGIVABLE SIN<br />
To blaspheme against the Holy Ghost one merely has to ascribe to Beelzebub the responsibility for certain healings Jesus allegedly performed. <br />
Mathew 12:31 &quot;He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters. And so I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or the age tp come.&quot; <br />
Mark 3:20-29 &quot;But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an eternal sin.&quot; <br />
.22 is where they accuse him of being possessed by Beelzebub and with that power could drive out demons. <br />
