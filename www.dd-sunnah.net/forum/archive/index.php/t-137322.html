Al-Albani: All of you must have heard of a group called the Sufis, and of a [type of] knowledge, or Sufi spiritual path [sulook] known as tasawwuf.<br />
 <br />
The people who ascribe themselves to this tasawwuf are of differing ranks, some of them have overstepped all limits and left Islaam in the name of Islamic Sufism, left Islaam just as a strand of hair is pulled out of dough . Why?<br />
 <br />
Because their interpretation of aayahs from the noble Quraan  and philosophy and apostasy are one and the same. In the eyes of the scholars of the Muslims they are known as the people who believe in [I]Wahdatul-Wujood [lit: the unity of existence], the ones who say the same thing as the atheists, but their wording differs from that of the atheists, they say, ëThere is nothing except one.í So [according to them] the universe that we see is Allaah. For this reason they are called people who believe in Wahdatul-Wujood.<br />
 <br />
The Muslims say that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah [Laa ilaaha illallaah], in this sentence there is an affirmation and a negation. There is a negation of whoever might interpret falsely (the presence of another god), then the affirmation that Allaah is the one and only God, the Most High.<br />
 <br />
As for those Sufis, then they say, ëThere is no He but He.í They then paraphrase it and make it a form of remembrance which they repeat for themselves, [saying], ëHe, He Öí <br />
 <br />
This is a dangerous deviation as you can see, i.e., a denial of the true existence of Allaah, and following on from that, a denial of the legislation, no Islaam Ö no Judaism, no Christianityñbecause there is no [differentiation between the] slave and the Lord, a Lord who obligates others to worship Him and a slave who is obligated to worship. For this reason one of them said:<br />
 <br />
[I]God [Rabb] is man and man is God<br />
How I wish to know who the one ordered (to perform worship) is<br />
 <br />
If you say man (is the one ordered), then that is a denial (of the presence of a God, based on the concept that God is man and man is God!)<br />
And if you say God, how can He be obligated?!<br />
 <br />
[According to them] there is no He but He. So in the end: He is He!<br />
 <br />
There are words that emanate from Muslims who bear witness  Laa ilaaha illallaah Muhammad Rasulullaah, these people are not atheists but they will sometimes utter words which lead them to that false aqidah. This is something very dangerous and hardly any but a few are safe from it.<br />
 <br />
Now in our normal gatherings [you will hear] one of them say whether on a particular occasion or not, ëAllaah is present in all that exists,í [this statement of theirs] equals, ëThere is no He but He.í<br />
 <br />
You will hear [this statement] many times, ëAllaah is present in all that exists,í and after close scrutiny of its meaning and purport and what it entails one can see that it equates to the saying of the Sufisñthe extremists amongst them obviouslyñwho openly declare that, ëThere is no He but He.í<br />
 <br />
 <br />
[B]There are Two Existents Not One<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Because if we were to ponder over the declaration of truth which is when a believer truly says, ëNone has the right to be worshiped except Allaah,í [then we will find] that it establishes two existences.<br />
 <br />
ëNone has the right to be worshiped except Allaah,í negates the false deities which are worshipped other than Allaah, and they are present [as is mentioned, for example,] in the Quraan in the statement of Noah to his people, ìAnd they have said, ëYou shall not leave your gods, nor shall you leave Wadd, nor Suwaí, nor Yaghuth, nor Yaíuq, nor Nasr.íî[Nooh 71:23] These were idols worshipped instead of Allaah, for that reason when Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, sent Noah ⁄·ÌÂ «·”·«„ to his people he ordered them to worship Allaah alone.<br />
 <br />
So, ëNone has the right to be worshiped Öí is a negation of the false deities which are present. ëÖ except Allaah,í is an affirmation of the existence of the Truth, i.e., Allaah the Blessed and Most High.<br />
 <br />
So there are two existences. It is not possible for a Muslim who, firstly, understands his Islaam and who, secondly, believes that Allaah created him, not to affirm two [separate] existents.<br />
 <br />
The scholars of tawheed refer to the First Existent, i.e., that of the Creator the Most High, He exists in His Essence, i.e., is eternal, having no beginning. So His existence is termed as being the necessarily existent [Waajibul-Wujood].<br />
As for the other existent then it is [called] the contingent or possible existent which is mankind and all creation. Allaah the Mighty and Majestic said to it, ëBe!í And it was. So it was preceded by nonexistence in contrast to the existence of Allaah the Mighty and Majesticñfor He is the First having no beginning, as you all know.</div></div><hr />
