the priority over giving allegiance to any new Khalifah, and he <br />
considered himself to have the right to demand retaliation according <br />
to Quran [17:33] because of he had the power to do so being the <br />
governor of Syria (i.e he himself represented the previous government <br />
in his region). This in itself is correct, but he was mistaken in <br />
giving retaliation the priority over paying allegiance to the new <br />
Khalif. Thus he is rewarded for his mistaken judgment once according <br />
to the hadith by Prophet Muhammad -pbuh-: &quot; If the Judge makes a <br />
judgment and he is mistaken then he has one reward and if he is <br />
correct he has two rewards.&quot; On the other hand Imam Ali-RA- has two <br />
rewards because he has made a correct judgment. Both of them were <br />
fighting for the truth and justice, and the Prophet -sala Allahu <br />
Alyhi Wa Salaam- told us that the party that fights the Khawarij (i.e <br />
Imam Ali) is the closer one to the truth: &quot; The group who would be <br />
nearer to the truth out of the two (discenting groups) would kill <br />
them.&quot; And also the Prophet -sala Allahu Alyhi wa Salaam- informed us <br />
that those who killed Amar are the oppressors. <br />
<br />
Allah -tala- said: &quot; If two parties among the Believers fall into a <br />
quarrel, make ye peace between them: but if one of them transgresses <br />
beyond bounds against the other, then fight ye against the one that <br />
transgresses until it complies with the Command of Allah; but if it <br />
complies, then make peace between them with justice, and be fair: for <br />
Allah loves those who are fair. The Believers are but a single <br />
Brotherhood: so make peace and reconciliation between your two<br />
brothers&quot; <br />
<br />
So we notice that Allah considered them brothers and believers, even <br />
though they have been oppressors. He did not call them evil-doers or <br />
wicked (fasiq) because of their oppression. Rather they are <br />
oppresors, mistaken and did not come to fight for the sake of killing <br />
but for the sake of defending justice. <br />
<br />
We also notice that Amar -RA- was killed by Abu Al-Adia -RA-, a <br />
companion of the Prophet -sala Allahu Alyhi Wa Salaam- who gave <br />
allegiance to him under the tree. Allah said: &quot; Certainly Allah was <br />
well pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance to you <br />
under the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down <br />
tranquillity on them and rewarded them with a near victory, and many <br />
acquisitions which they will take; and Allah is Mighty, Wise&quot; <br />
[48:19]<br />
<br />
. So we know that Allah knew what was in his heart, and <br />
made <br />
tranquility descend upon him, and was pleased with him. However, Abu <br />
Al Adia -RA- made a wrong judgment, oppressing Amar, and still he is <br />
rewarded once for making the judgment.<br />
<br />
Their claim that taking retaliation from the murderes of Uthman -RA- <br />
is obligatory for they have opened war against Allah and His <br />
Messenger -pbuh- and have made corruption into this earth, severing <br />
the sanctity of Islam, Medinah, the Immigration of Uthman, and his <br />
Khilafah, and being one of the early companions of the Prophet -pbuh-<br />
,and Ali -RA- did not differ with them on this point, rather the <br />
murderers and their protecting tribes were of great numbers and Ali -<br />
RA- was incapable of fighting them, thus the obligation to get <br />
retaliation is not true for the sake of Ameer-ul-Momineen, just as <br />
the obligation for prayer, fasting, Hajj drop from those incapable of <br />
performing them. Allah -tala- said: &quot; Allah tasketh not a soul beyond <br />
its scope&quot; <br />
<br />
Had Muawiyah given allegiance to Ali -RA- then he would have had more <br />
power to take retaliation from the murderers of Uthman, just as he <br />
took retaliation from the murderers of Abdullah Ibn Khabab -RA- in <br />
the battle of Nahrawan. And this discension has only caused all <br />
parties to be weaker.<br />
<br />
As for considering Ali's -RA- late allegiance to Abu Bakr, then this <br />
is not a correct model for Muawiya -RA- to build on. Had Muawiya -RA- <br />
acted similiarly and given allegiance shortly then this would be the <br />
correct thing to do.<br />
<br />
As for considering that Al-Zubair and Talha and Sa'ad all being good <br />
candidates for the position of Khilafah along with Ali -Radia Allah <br />
Anhu- then the first person out of them whom the Muslims pay <br />
allegiance to then his soverignty is legal and binding. Just as <br />
Uthman's -RA- allegiance was binding as soon as he was declared <br />
Khalifah.<br />
<br />
Finally, truth at times might not be clear for knowledgable <br />
companions of the Prophet -pbuh-, for they are human beings, and <br />
companions have made mistakes in matters that are more obvious than <br />
this and Allah is the Guide.<br />
<br />
For us,respecting them and asking Allah for their forgiveness is <br />
still demanded by Allah and His Messenger -pbuh-<br />
