Allah subhana wa talla' says in surrat Alana'm verse [136]:&quot; Out of what Allah hath produced in abundance in tilth and in cattle, they assigned Him a share: they say, according to their fancies: &quot;This is for Allah, and this is for our 'partners'! But the share of their &quot;partners&quot; reacheth not Allah, whilst the share of Allah reacheth their &quot;partners!&quot; Evil (and unjust) is their assignment! &quot;<br />
<br />
* Pagans knew that Allah subhana wa talla' is existed.. <br />
<br />
* They did worships (others) with Allah subhana wa talla'..<br />
<br />
And now Shittes they join companions with Allah subhana wa talla' in their worships, &amp; they know that Allah subhana wa talla' is existed..<br />
<br />
In that previous verse, there is reprimand &amp; dispraise  from Allah subhana wa talla 2 the Pagans that they did heresy and theyíve associate with Allah subhana wa talla, &amp; our Lord is The Creator of everything..!<br />
<br />
Whatís the diffrent between past &amp; present Pagans ..?</div></div><hr />

that was really useful, for the discussion with most non-muslims (what ever their religion was).<br />
<br />
Subhan Allah, every time I focus on a Quran verse, I realize that every single verse can be explained with thousands of books (Human made).</div></div><hr />
