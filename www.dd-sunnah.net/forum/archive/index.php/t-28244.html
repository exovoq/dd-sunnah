Dear brothers and sisters,<br />
<br />
I have received this interesting letter addressed to Al-Sistani on my yahoo group. Notice how the Rafidites are killing each other because of the khums:<br />
<br />
From: `Isa Adam Naziri [mailto:<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="652b041f0c170c253104090c1c040d4b0a1702">[email&#160;protected]</a>] <br />

Subject: Questions on Terrorism and Takfir: Please Confirm of Deny Insha'Allah <br />
<br />
Bismillah, ir-Rahman ir-Rahim <br />
<br />
As-Salaamu `alaykum, wa-Rahmat'ullahi, wa-Barakatu to our Brothers and Sisters in the Middle East... <br />
<br />
It has come to my attention by several of your muqallidin that you have ordered some of your muqallidin from Rochester, New York, USA and Ottowa, Canada to burn down my house and assassinate myself and friends and family (who they have publically and privately threatened, supposedly at your bequest). <br />
<br />
Insha'Allah ta'ala this is news to you and you have never heard such an outlandish thing before, nor have you in fact ordered it as these terrorists have claimed. The people associated with a website whose URL is http://www.shiachat.com have initiated a slander and attack campaign against our Jammat, the Taliy'ah al-Mahdi (http://www.taliyah.org). <br />
<br />
They have claimed that you have told them not only to commit acts of terrorism, arson and murder against us, but they also claim that you are &quot;working on&quot; a fatwah pronouncing takfir on us because we believe the Qayim of the Imam al-Mahdi (as) is very near at hand insha'Allah! <br />
<br />
To be clear, we believe in all of the Arkaan, all of the Fara'id. <br />
<br />
We believe that Muhammad (sal) is the Khatam al-Nabiyyin. <br />
<br />
We believe in all 12 A'immah (as). <br />
<br />
We believe in the Yawm al-Qiyyamah, and Yawm ad-Din, and we believe in the raja of those righteous individuals and the kuffar who the A'immah (as) told us in narrations will insha'Allah return. <br />
<br />
We believe that anyone professing to be a Nabi or Rasul after Muhammad (sal) is an imposter. <br />
<br />
We believe in paying the Zakah and Khums. <br />
<br />
We believe in the Sawm of Shahar Ramadan, and we encourage many other siyam in accordance with the Sunnah. <br />
<br />
We believe in making Hajj both physically and spiritually if one is financially able to do so. <br />
<br />
We believe in making Jihad and in preparing for the Qayim of the Imam al-Qa'im (as), yet not waging offensive Jihad before the Qayim that we do not claim to know the date of. <br />
<br />
We believe in the Qayim of the 12th Imam al-Mahdi ibn Imam al-Askari (as). <br />
<br />
If you find us to be in error in any of our `aqida, then please point out which of such beliefs are in error. If not then please confirm or deny what these terrorists have told us about you prouncing takfir upon us and ordering arson, terrorism and murder against us. <br />
<br />
Please clear up this fitna and let us move on, able to know that these are lies fabricated in your name and you have nothing to do with such things insha'Allah ta'ala. <br />
<br />
May Allah hasten the end of suffering through the Imam's Rise! <br />
<br />
To a Victory for the Downtrodden and Oppressed! <br />
`Isa Adam Naziri</div></div><hr />
