<br />
Every now and then Shia polemists try to present to Muslims narrations taken from books, allegedly claimed to be Sunni, in order to prove their beliefs from the books of Ahlul Sunnah wal Jamaaí.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It is well documented that in the religion of Shias, taqiyya permits that Shias would appear to the public as Sunnis and hide their beliefs. To this effect Al-Khoei says in Al-Tanqeeh , an exegesis of Al-Urwatul Wuthqa [4/332-333]: ì This is because what is benefited from the narrations about Taqiyya is that it is has only been instituted so that Shia can hide from those who differ with them and that they would not be known to be Shia or Rafidi, and for the concealment from them and complimenting them. It is evident that when the designee shows the madhab of Hanbalis infront of the Hanafi for example or vice versa , then concealment and not appearing as Shia or Rafidi is established with this and compliment happened with them. So if he prayed in the masjid of Hanafis according to the Madhab of Hanbalis then it could be truthfully said that he has prayed in their masjids or with them. The secret in that is that what is obligatory is just Taqiyya with the public (i.e Sunna), concealment (of identity) and complimenting them. None of the previously mentioned proofs makes obligatory the following of their different kinds m and there is no proof for the compulsion to follow the madhab of the one being feared, rather what is essential is the concealment and compliment with the public (i.e Sunnis) and hiding Shiasm from them.î <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Muhammad Ibn Al-Hussan Ibn Abdul Samad who is known as Shiekh Bahai (d. 1031) said: ìI was in Syria appearing to be a Shafiiî. This confession by this under cover Shia was reported by Muhammad Muhammadi Ashtihardi in his book ìAjwad Al-Munatharatî (1/188)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In this post I will try to point out some such books and authors that are falsely ascribed to Ahlul Sunnah Wal Jamaaí:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(1) Al-Kanji Al-Shafii:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The editor of his book: ì Al-Bayan fee Akhbar Sahib Al-Zamanî, who is also a Shiite, said: ì I have not come across a complete biography of Hafidh Al-Kanji Al-Shafi, for he has been ignored by many of his contemporary historians such as Ibn Khilikan in (Wafiyat Al-Ayan) , Abu Shama in (Al-Dhayl ala Al-Rawdatayn) , Al-Yunini in (Miraíat Al-Zaman) , Al-Dhahabi in (Tathkirat Al-Hufadh).î<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He also said: ì Historians mentioned that Hafidh Al-Kanji was killed in the year 658 , in the Ummayad Jami in Damascus , on the hands of the public who were antagonized by his reclining to Shia. Some others have added another reason for his murder, being that he used to deal with the Tatar and accepted a position that they gave to him as well as the money (molested) from those who were absent from his country.î<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ibn Katheer, in Al-Bidaya wal Nihaya, clearly identifies him as a Rafidi: ì In the middle of the Jami, the public killed a Rafidi Shiekh who was helping Tatar over the money of people called Al-Fakhr Muhammad Ibn Yusuf Ibn Muhammad Al-Kanji. He had evil intentions , and was from the East , helping them over the money of Muslims. May Allah disparage him. And they killed a group of hypocrites of his likes, so an end was put to those who transgressed. Al-Hamdullilahî<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(2) Ibn Abi Al-Hadid:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The author of ìRawdat Al-Jannatî (5/19) referred to him as: ì He is loyal to people of the Household of infallibility and purity (Ahlul Bayt Al-Ismaí wal Tahara) even though he used to appear in the costume of Ahlul Sunnahî<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In ìAl-Kunna wal Al-Alqabî, Al-Qumi outlines the staunch and fanatic Shiite background of Ibn Abi Al-Hadid in Al-Madain and then when he moved to Baghdad his fanaticism reduced and was inclined to Mutazilla.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(3) Sulayman Ibn Muhammad Al-Qunduzi Al-Hanafi:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He is the author of Yanabií Al-Mawada. Aga Buzurg Tehrani included his book ìAl-Thareeaî , which is an Encyclopedia on Shia books. He said [25/290] : ì Even though the Shiasm of the author is not known, but he is Gnostic, and the Book is considered to be one of the books of Shiaî<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(4) Ibrahim Ibn Muhammad Al-Juwaini (also called Al-Hamweeni):<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He is the author of ìFaraid Al-Simtaynî He has been included in the book ìAyan Al-Shiaî , an Encyclodia of Shia prominent figures, by Al-Ameen Al-Amili. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Aga Buzurgh Tehrani, in ìThayl Kashf Al-Dhunoonî p. 70, pointed out that the chief of the Mongols, Ghazan, embrassed Islam through him and became a Shiite, and also his brother Shah Khudabanda who made his Shiasm apparent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Amongst the sheikhs that he was taught by, are Ibn Al-Muttahir Al-Hili and Khawaja Nusair Al-Din Al-Tusi. These are two prominent 12er figures. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(5) Yusuf Fargali, known as the grandson of (Sibt) Ibn Al_Jawzi:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He is the author of (Miraat Al-Zaman). Al-Dhahabi said: ì He has authored (Miraat Al-Zaman) and included very odd narrations in it (manakir). I do not think he is thiqqa in things he reports rather he exaggerates and goes aside. He then converted to Rafidism , and authored a book to this effect. Shiekh Muhiydin said: When the news of Sibt Ibn Al-Jawziís death reached my grandfather, he said: ì May Allah not have mercy on him. He was a Rafidiî<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(6) The book ìAl-Imamah wal Riyasa&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Brother Murabitoon has posted a good exposition of it on the following link.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
(7) Nur Al-Din Ali Ibn Muhammad Ibn Al-Sabagh Al-Maliki<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Author of ìAl-Fusool Al-Muhimaî.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
His book is included in ìAl-Dhareeaî [16/246]. Tehrani said: ìIn the treatise ìShia Shiekhsî he is considered one of them, even though he is one of the great Malikis, this is why in ìKashf Al-Dhunoonî he said: ì Some of them attributed the author to Rafidism for what he mentioned in his introduction / khutba.î<br />
