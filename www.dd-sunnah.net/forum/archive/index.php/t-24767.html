<br />
<br />
Emma is a lawyer<br />
And so is Aisha too<br />
Colleagues going into court<br />
At circa half past two<br />
<br />
Its 1 O'clock right now<br />
They grab a bite before the trial<br />
They chat about this and that<br />
Conversing with a smile<br />
<br />
Aisha is in full hijab<br />
With a loose all over suit<br />
Emma's in her business wear<br />
With accessories to boot<br />
<br />
Emma's really quite bemused<br />
At Aisha's godly ways<br />
She looks Aisha in the eyes<br />
And very firmly says<br />
<br />
You're a smart girl Aisha<br />
Why do you wear that across your hair?<br />
Subjugated by &quot;man&quot;-kind<br />
An object of despair<br />
<br />
Take it off my sister<br />
Let your banner be unfurled<br />
Don't blindly follow all around<br />
DECLARE YOUR FREEDOM TO THE WORLD<br />
<br />
Aisha is amazed<br />
But not the least bit shy<br />
She bravely puts her milk shake down<br />
And gives Emma the reply<br />
<br />
My dear sister Emma,<br />
Why do you dress the way you do?<br />
The skirt you're wearing round your waist,<br />
Is it really you?<br />
<br />
Now that we've sat down,<br />
I see you tug it across your thighs,<br />
Do you feel ashamed?<br />
Aware of prying eyes?<br />
<br />
I see the way you're sitting,<br />
Both legs joined at the knees,<br />
Who forces you to sit like that?<br />
Do you feel at ease?<br />
<br />
I'll tell you who obliges you,<br />
To dress the way you do,<br />
Gucci, Klein and St. Laurent,<br />
All have designs on you!<br />
<br />
In the main, its men my friend,<br />
Who dictate the whims of fashion,<br />
Generating all the garb,<br />
To incite the basest passion<br />
<br />
&quot;Sex Sells&quot; there is no doubt,<br />
But who buys with such great haste,<br />
The answer is the likes of you,<br />
Because they want to be embraced......<br />
<br />
They want to be accepted,<br />
On a level playing field<br />
Sure, with brain and intellect<br />
But with body parts revealed<br />
<br />
Intelligence and reason<br />
Are useful by and by<br />
But if you want to make a mark<br />
Stay appealing to the eye<br />
<br />
You claim your skirt is office like<br />
A business dress of sorts<br />
Would we not laugh at Tony Blair<br />
If he turned up in shorts?<br />
<br />
His could be the poshest pants<br />
Pinstripe from Saville Rowe<br />
But walking round like that my friend<br />
He'd really have to go<br />
<br />
Why do you douse yourself with creams<br />
To make your skin so milky?<br />
Why do rip off all your hair<br />
To keep your body silky?<br />
<br />
A simple shower's all you need<br />
To stay respectable and clean<br />
The time and money that you spend<br />
Is really quite obscene<br />
<br />
Why do you wake up at dawn,<br />
To apply a firm foundation,<br />
Topped with make up and the like,<br />
In one chaotic combination?<br />
<br />
And if you should have to leave the house<br />
Devoid of this routine<br />
Why do you feel so insecure<br />
That you should not be seen?<br />
<br />
Be free my sister Emma<br />
Escape from your deep mire<br />
Don hijab today my friend<br />
And all Islam's attire<br />
<br />
Avoid all those sickly stares<br />
Or whistles from afar<br />
Walk down the street with dignity<br />
Take pride in who you are<br />
<br />
Strength lies in anonymity<br />
Be a shadow in the crowd<br />
Until you speak and interact<br />
When your voice will carry loud<br />
<br />
You're a smart girl Emma<br />
Wear this across your hair<br />
Don't be subjugated by &quot;man&quot;-kind<br />
An object of despair<br />
<br />
To use your very words my friend<br />
Let your banner be unfurled<br />
Don't blindly follow all around<br />
DECLARE YOUR FREEDOM TO THE WORLD<br />
