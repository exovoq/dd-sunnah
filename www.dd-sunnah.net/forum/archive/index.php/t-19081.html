<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">«·√⁄‘Ï</div><div class="date">21-08-03, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The following narrations help us understand that even if the companions of the Prophet ñpbuh- differed in opinions and fought for what they believed was the truth, this did not severe the brotherly relationships they had as Muslims:<br />
<br />
Ibn Rahoya narrated on the authority of Abu Jafar Muhammad Al-Baqer ñ rahimahu Allah-: &quot;Ali ñ Radia Allahu Anhu- heard a man, at the battle of the Camel or Sifeen, exaggerating in his speech. He said: &quot; Only say that which is good. They are a group of people who claim that we have transgressed over them and we claim that they have transgressed against us so we fought against them.&quot; It was mentioned to Abu Jafar that he took from them their weapons (as booty), and he responded: &quot;He was no in need of it)&quot;<br />
<br />
Ibn Asaker narrated that Abu Muslim Al-Khawlani came along with <br />
other men to Muwaiya ñ Radia Allahu Anhu- and said: &quot; Do you compete<br />
 with Ali or are you his like?<br />
 <br />
He said: No! By Allah I know that he is better than me and has more<br />
 right to rule than me. But do you not know that Uthman was killed unjustly,<br />
 and I am his cousin and I am the one who demands his blood so go<br />
 to him and ask him to hand over to me the murderers of Uthman and <br />
I will leave this matter to him.<br />
 <br />
So they came to Ali ñ Radia Allahi Anhu- and talked to him, but he<br />
 did not hand them over.&quot;<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
&quot;And those who came after them say: &quot;Our Lord! Forgive us, and our <br />
brethren who came before us into the Faith, and leave not, in our hearts,<br />
 rancour against those who have believed. Our Lord! Thou art indeed<br />
 Full of Kindness, Most Merciful.&quot; [59:10]</div></div><hr />
