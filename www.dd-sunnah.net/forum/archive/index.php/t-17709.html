<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StraightPath</div><div class="date">28-07-03, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1.  Allaah is the Only Truth.<br />
<br />
Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta`aalaa) says in the Quríaan:<br />
<br />
&quot;That is because Allaah - He is the Truth and it is He who gives life to dead.&quot; (Quríaan, Chapter 22, Verse 6)<br />
<br />
The Naqshbandi Belief: Aba Yazid al-Bistami is the Truth.<br />
On page 15 of the book ëThe Naqshbandi Wayí it reads :<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoever recites this Ayah even a single time will attain a high rank and a great position, Ö he will get what the Prophets and saints could not get, and will arrive at the stage of Aba Yazid al-Bistami, the Imam of the order who said: &quot;I am the Truth (al-Haqq).&quot;<br />
<br />
The above statement ëI am the Truthí - is a clear example of Shirk (association) in the aspect of the Names and Attributes of Allaah, since Al-Haqq in the definite form, is one of Allaahís unique attributes and is not shared by any created being or thing unless preceded by the prefix `Abd meaning &quot;Slave of&quot; or &quot;Servant of&quot;. (In fact the Mystic al-Hallaaj was publicly executed as an apostate for daring to openly claim divinity in his infamous pronouncement &quot;Anal-Haqq&quot;- I am the Truth.)<br />
<br />
2. The Islaamic Belief: None shares with the command of Allaah<br />
<br />
Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta`aalaa) says in the Quríaan,<br />
<br />
&quot;Verily, His (Allaahís) command, when He intends a thing, is only that he says to it, &quot;Be! And it is!&quot; (Chapter 36, Verse 82);<br />
<br />
And in another place in the Quríaan, Allaah says;<br />
<br />
&quot;They have no protector other than Him (Allaah); nor does He share His command with any person whatsoever.&quot; (Chapter 18, Verse 26)<br />
<br />
The Naqshbandi Belief: Sheikh shares with the command of Allaah<br />
On page 33 of the book ëMercy Oceans - Part 1í, it reads :<br />
<br />
&quot;The Power of the wali is such that he only needs to say Kun (be) and that will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
The above is another example of Shirk (association) in the aspect of the Lordship of Allaah, since the Islaamic principle of the Lordship of Allaah states that no created being can share in Godís attributes and infinite qualities, and any attempt to give the Divine attributes to creation is referred to as Shirk (association), the antithesis of Tawheed (singling out Allaah alone for worship).<br />
<br />
3. The Islaamic Belief: None could attain the Rank of the Prophets or their Companions.<br />
<br />
The Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) has said in a well known Hadith that,<br />
<br />
&quot;The best of people are those living in my generation, and then those who will follow them, and then those who will follow the latterÖ&quot; (Saheeh Bukhaaree, Vol 5, Hadith #3, Arabic-English Trans.)<br />
<br />
The Naqshbandi Belief: Certain people could attain a Rank higher than the Prophets and their Companions. On page 1 of the book ëThe Naqshbandi Wayí it reads,<br />
<br />
&quot;Our master the Sheikh says that a person who manages to act on these principles in our times will achieve what earlier generations did not achieve Ö he who attains an exalted stage and a great rank, such a rank which the Prophets themselves and the companions were unable to attain.&quot;<br />
<br />
On page 4 of the book ëthe Naqshbandi Wayí it reads,<br />
<br />
&quot;Especially those who hold to the Prophetís Sunnah, will attain special stations that werenít opened to earlier people - not even to the Prophetís companions.í<br />
<br />
The deviant claim of attaining the rank which the Prophets could not is a major deception of the Naqshbandiya as any Muslim with even the basic knowledge of Islaam will confirm. As regards the companions (May Allaah be pleased with them all), the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) in a hadith narrated by Anas bin Maalik (Radhiallaahu Anhu) said,<br />
<br />
&quot;After me, you will see others given preference to you, so be patient till you meet me.&quot; (Saheeh Bukhaaree, Vol 5., Hadith #137, Arabic-English Trans.)<br />
<br />
He (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) also said in reference to his Companions (May Allaah be pleased with them all),   &quot;For by Him in Whose hand is my soul, if you were to spend the like of Uhud or of the mountains in gold, you would not reach their actions.&quot; (Saheeh Bukhaaree)<br />
<br />
4. The Islaamic Belief:  Allaah is above the heavens.<br />
<br />
Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta`aalaa) says in the Quríaan,<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you feel secure, that He (Allaah), who is above the heavens, will not cause the earth to sink with you.&quot; (Quríaan, Chapter 67, Verse 16)<br />
<br />
And in a long Hadith found in Saheeh Muslim, it is narrated that the companion Mu`awiyah ibn al-Hakam, (Radhiallaahu Anhu) slapped his servant girl who used to tend his sheep, and as a result when to the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) and asked what should be done as an atonement for having slapped her. The Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) replied, &quot;Bring her to me&quot; so Mu`awiyah brought her to the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam). The Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) then asked her, &quot;Where is Allaah?&quot; and she replied &quot;Above the Sky&quot; then the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam ) asked her, &quot;Who am I?&quot; and she replied, &quot;You are Allaahís Messenger&quot;, so the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) said, &quot;Free her, for verily she is a true believer.&quot; (Saheeh Muslim, Vol 1, Hadith #1094, English Translation)<br />
<br />
The Naqshbandi Belief:  Allaah is Everywhere.<br />
On page 13 of the book Haqiqat ul Haqqani it reads,<br />
<br />
&quot;Allaah Almighty is everywhere but specially in the Baitullaah as He has Himself called it the house of Allaah. For it to be called the house of the Lord, the Lord of the house must be in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The concept of Allaah being everywhere is not Islaamic as the above Quríaanic Aayah and the authentic hadith confirm. Indeed if Allaah was everywhere then there would be no need for the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) to go up through the seven skies on the night of Mi`raaj to meet Allaah - he would have been in the direct presence of Allaah in his very own house.<br />
<br />
5. The Islaamic Belief: None has the knowledge of the Last Day except Allaah.<br />
<br />
Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta`aalaa) says in the Quríaan,<br />
<br />
&quot;Verily the knowledge of the Hour is with Allaah (alone).&quot; (31:34)<br />
<br />
And according to the well known Hadith, where Angel Jibreel (`alaihis salaam) came in the guise of man, we quote the part of the Hadith that is relevant to our matter, after asking about Islaam, Imaan and Ihsaan, Angel Jibreel (`alaihis salaam) asks Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) &quot;then tell me about the hour (meaning the last day)&quot;, the Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) replied, &quot;The one questioned about it knows no better than the questioner.&quot; (Saheeh Muslim, vol 1, Hadith #4, English Translation)<br />
<br />
The Naqshbandi Belief: Sheikh has the knowledge of the Last Day.<br />
In the beginning of page 19 of the book ëMercy Oceans - part oneí, it reads -<br />
<br />
&quot;These signs have been given us indication that the Last Day is coming is nearly exactly now Öwe shall witness that great event within two years.&quot;<br />
<br />
The above book (Mercy Oceans) was published in 1987 and it I almost nine years since its publication, but the last day is still not witnessed. How could it be when indeed Allaah has clearly stated in the Quríaan,<br />
<br />
&quot;Say None in the heavens and the earth knows the unseen except Allaah.&quot; (Quríaan, Chapter 27, Verse 65)<br />
<br />
6. The Islaamic Belief: Believers and disbelievers are not equal.<br />
<br />
Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta`aalaa) says in the Quríaan,<br />
<br />
&quot;The likeness of the two parties (disbelievers and believers) is as the blind and the deaf and the seer and the hearer. Are they equal when compared? Will you not then take heed?&quot; (Quríaan, Chapter 11, Verse 24)<br />
<br />
The Naqshbandi Belief: Believers and disbelievers are equal.<br />
On page 12 of the book ëthe Naqshbandi Wayí, it reads;<br />
<br />
&quot;Allaah does not distinguish between the non-believer and the faasiq (wrong doer) or between a believer and a Muslim. In fact they are all equal to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Furthermore, on page 16 of the same book it reads, &quot;Allaah does not distinguish between a kaafir or a hypocrite or between a saint and a Prophet.&quot;<br />
<br />
7. The Islaamic Belief: No intermediary between Allaah and Man.<br />
<br />
Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta`aalaa) says in the Quríaan,<br />
<br />
&quot;And when My servants ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them in knowledge), I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me.&quot; (Quríaan, Chapter 2, Verse 186)<br />
<br />
The Naqshbandi Belief: Sheikh is intermediary between Allaah and Man.<br />
On page 23 of the book Haqiqat ul Haqqani it reads,<br />
<br />
&quot;If there wasnít Mowlana Sheikh Nazim between us and Seyyidina Mahdi (Alai), or between us and the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Sal), or between us and Allaah Almighty, no one would be able to reach to Divine knowledgeÖ this is because Mowlana Sheikh Nazim is the intermediary between us and these stations.&quot;<br />
<br />
[It should be known that the practice and belief of having an intermediary between man and God is a pagan practice, borrowed directly from other religions like Christianity which believes the Pastor or the church priest to be an intermeidary between man and God and hence confession of oneís sins is done to them and not directly to God.]<br />
<br />
8. The Islaamic Belief: No spokesman between Allaah and Man on the Day of Judgment.<br />
<br />
Adi bin Hatim (radhiallaahu `anhu) reported that the Messenger (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) said, &quot;There is none of you but his Lord will certainly talk to with him without any Spokesman between him and his Lord.&quot; (Sunan Ibn Maajah, Vol 1, Hadith #185, English Translation)<br />
<br />
The Naqshbandi Belief: Sheikh will be a spokesman between Man and Allaah on the Day of Judgment. On page 11 of the book Haqiqat ul Haqqani it reads,<br />
<br />
&quot;When a person takes Bayyat from Mowlana, Mowlana will be with that person. Even until he reaches in front of Allaah Almighty will Mowlana be with him, when Allaah Almighty questions this person Mowlana shall answer all questions instead of him.&quot;<br />
<br />
9. The Islaamic Belief: (For anything to happen) it is only what Allaah wills.<br />
<br />
Once a companion of the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) concluded his statement to the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) with the phrase &quot;It is what Allaah wills and you will.&quot; The Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) immediately corrected him saying - ëAre you making me an equal with Allaah? Say it is what Allaah alone wills.í (Collected by Ahmad - Arabic)<br />
<br />
The Naqshbandi Belief: It is what Allaah and the saint wills.<br />
On page 23 of the book &quot;Quthub us Sailan&quot; which is written by the local head of the group, it reads<br />
<br />
&quot;One morning in the newspapers, I read that the wakf board had taken over the Dewatagaha Mosque seeking the chief trustee at the time, chairman of the welfare committee and chief trustee, M.I.M. Shaukat came to my place a couple of days later to find out what he could do in that matter as chief trustee, I told him that if it was the will of Allaah and the saint, well nothing could be done on his part.&quot;<br />
<br />
10. The Islaamic Belief: Allaah is in charge of creation.<br />
<br />
Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta`aalaa) says in the Quríaan,<br />
<br />
&quot;And Allaah is a Wakil (Guardian) over all things.&quot; (Quríaan, Chapter 11, Verse 12)<br />
<br />
And in another place, Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta`aalaa) says,<br />
<br />
&quot;He (Allaah) arranges (every) affair from the heavens to the earth.&quot; (Quríaan, Chapter 32, Verse 3)<br />
<br />
The Naqshbandi Belief: Sheikh is in charge of creation.<br />
On page 15 of the book ëHaqiqat ul Haqqanií it reads,<br />
<br />
&quot;Every thing that you know of is under the spiritual control of the Sultan al Awliya, he is the one who is in charge of all mankind in this universe, he is also in charge of all the world of Jinns and Angels.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again the above belief is one of Shirk (association) in the aspect of the Lordship of Allaah, as has been explained before.<br />
<br />
11. The Islaamic Belief: None can change a bad situation except Allaah.<br />
<br />
Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta`aalaa) says in the Quríaan,<br />
<br />
&quot;And if Allaah touches you with harm, none can remove it but HeÖ&quot; (Quríaan, Chapter 6, verse 17)<br />
<br />
The Naqshbandi Belief: Sheikh can change a bad situation.<br />
On page 26 of the book ëHaqiqat ul Haqqanií in the 2nd paragraph it reads,<br />
<br />
&quot;If a bad situation is to come to a mureed of his, Sheikh has the power to change it.&quot;<br />
<br />
12. The Islaamic Belief: None can make anyone enter paradise or save from hell, except Allaah.<br />
<br />
The Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) said in an authentic Hadith, &quot;O People of Quraysh, secure deliverance from Allaah (by doing good deeds). I cannot help you at all against Allaah. O sons of Abdul-Muttalib, I cannot help you at all against Allaah; O (my uncle) Abbas ibn Abdul-Muttalib, O (my aunt) Safeeyah, I cannot help you at all against Allaah; O Faatimah, daughter of Muhammad, ask me whatever you like, but I have nothing which can help you against Allaah.&quot; (Saheeh Muslim, Vol 1, Hadith #402, English Translation)<br />
<br />
The Naqshbandi Belief: Sheikh can make one enter paradise and save one from hell.<br />
On page 30 of the book Haqiqat ul Haqqani, in the 3rd paragraph, it reads -<br />
<br />
&quot;Sheikh will not allow any of his mureeds to enter hell, Ö Sheikh Nazim will make all the followers to enter into this paradise.&quot;<br />
<br />
13. The Islaamic Belief: The Angel of death will take the soul of the dying.<br />
<br />
Allaah (Subhaanahu wa ta`aalaa) says in the Quríaan,<br />
<br />
&quot;Say the Angel of death, who is set over you, will take your souls, then you shall be brought to your Lord.&quot; (Quríaan, 32:11)<br />
<br />
The Naqshbandi Belief: Sheikh will take the soul of the dying<br />
On page 35 of the book ëHaqiqat ul Haqqanií under the heading ëNo questioning in the graveí, it reads;<br />
<br />
&quot;As for anyone who is related to Mowlana Sheikh Nazim as a mureed, the Angel of Death Israel (Alai) will have nothing to do with him, the soul of this mureed at the time of his death will be taken by Mowlana Sheikh Nazim, he shall look at the mureed and immediately the soul of that mureed will leave his body. There is nothing for either the Angel of death or for the Angels of the grave to do with the mureeds of Sheikh Nazim.&quot; <br />
<br />
14. The Islaamic Belief: No hidden knowledge in Islaam, everything is given in the Quríaan and Sunnah.<br />
<br />
The Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) said in an authentic hadith, &quot;I have not left anything which Allaah ordered you with, except that I have ordered you with it, nor anything that Allaah forbade you, except that I forbade you from it.&quot; (Saheeh, al-Baihaqee 7:76, Arabic)<br />
<br />
The Naqshbandi Belief: Sheikh has hidden knowledge.<br />
In spite of the above clear hadith, the deviant Naqshbandi claim that there is ësecret knowledgeí with the Sheikh, for example on page 60-61 of the book ëHaqiqat ul Haqqanií in the 3rd paragraph it reads;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vast amounts of hidden knowledge have been communicated to his mureeds by Mowlana Sheikh Nazim in this manner. Questions by these mureeds regarding day to day life, or questions relating to religion Ö and also many other subjects have been answered by Mowlana Sheikh Nazim. When this type of communication has been granted to a mureed, he no longer needs to resort to books to further his knowledge.&quot;<br />
<br />
15. The Islaamic Belief: When Allaah loves a personÖ<br />
<br />
The Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) said as narrated by Abu Huraira (radhiallaahu `anhu) that, &quot;ÖAllaah saidÖthe most beloved things with which my slave comes nearer to Me, is with what I have enjoined upon him, and my slave keeps on coming closer to Me through performing Nawafil (praying or doing extra deeds besides what is obligatory) till I love him, so I become his sense of hearing with which he hears, and his sense of sight with which he sees, and his hand with which he gripsÖ&quot; (Saheeh Bukhaaree, Vol 8, Hadith 509, Arabic - English Trans)<br />
<br />
[The above hadith should not be misinterpreted by the reader. What it simply means is as has been explained by the Scholars of Hadith is that, when Allaah becomes his sense of hearing means the servant will only hear Halaal speech and will keep away from hearing forbidden speech. And regarding sight, then it means he will only see that which is permissible to see and keep away from seeing that which is Haraam and in the case of the hands then it means he will only touch and use his hands in that which is Halaal and will refrain from touching and doing Haraam with it.]<br />
<br />
The Naqshbandi Belief: Directly contradicts the above hadith.<br />
On page 62 of the book ëHaqiqat ul Haqqanií in the last paragraph it reads,<br />
<br />
&quot;Certain of the mureeds of Mowlana Sheikh Nazim experience that Mowlana appears within them, when this happens, they are no longer conscious of themselves as themselves, they lose their identity and are conscious of themselves as their Sheikh. They see through Mowlanaís eyes when the look, they hear through Mowlanaís ears when they hear, and they speak Mowlanaís words when they speak..&quot;<br />
<br />
15a The Naqshbandi Belief: Sheikh can be in any place at the same time. <br />
<br />
On page 33 of the book ëHaqiqat ul Haqqanií it reads,<br />
<br />
&quot;Mowlana Sheikh Nazim can also be present in his shape and body in several places at the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Also on page 65 of the same book it reads in the 2nd paragraph,<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes, mureeds have been transported to other countries and places. For example, they may be transported in a moment to LondonÖsome are known to have visited Mecca, Medina, London and Baghdad in moments by the power and the grace of Sheikh Nazim.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Islaamic Position: on the above Naqshbandi position<br />
<br />
In a Hadith, the Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) said, &quot;There are three types of Jinn, one type flies through the airÖ&quot; (Transmitted by al-Haakim, Tabaraani and al-Baihaqi, Arabic)<br />
<br />
And Allaah says in the Quríaan,<br />
<br />
&quot;And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the masculine among the jinns, but they (jinns) increased them (mankind) in sin and disbelief.&quot; (Quríaan, 72:6)<br />
<br />
15b The Naqshbandi Belief: Sheikh has two faces. <br />
<br />
On page 21 of the book ëHaqiqat ul Haqqanií in the first paragraph describing Sheikh Nazim, it reads,<br />
<br />
&quot;He (Sheikh) now has a face towards the creatures and a face towards Allaah Almighty, therefore he is with Allaah Almighty all the time!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Islaamic Position: on the above Naqshbandi belief<br />
<br />
The Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) rightly said, as reported by the companion Abu Huraira (radhiallaahu `anhu) who said that Allaahís Messenger (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) said, &quot;The worst amongst the people is the double faced one.&quot; (Saheeh Muslim, vol 4, Hadith #6300 - English Translation)<br />
<br />
Also, the companion Ammaar (radhiallaahu `anhu) reported the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) as saying, &quot;He who is two faced in this world, will have two tongues of fire on the day of resurrection.&quot; (Sunan Abu Dawud, Vol 3, Hadith #4855 - English Translation)<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
From the preceding, concise presentation of the Naqshbandi groupís deviant beliefs, in shaaí Allaah, there should not remain even the slightest inkling of a doubt in the mind of the sincere reader about the groupís deviant nature and falsehood. It is only the ignorant, grossly biased and dishonest sympathizers of the group who will still maintain the view that the groupís teachings and beliefs are in accordance with the Quríaan and Sunnah, since it has been clearly and decisively proven to be just the exact opposite.<br />
<br />
In the foregoing article, the reader would have noticed that every thing of the pure Islamic Belief mentioned has been contradicted by this deviant group. In fact the Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) had warned us about the appearance of such deviant groups, when he said in an authentic narration reported by Abu Amir al-Hawdani (radhiallaahu `anhu), &quot;Indeed those who were before you, from the people of the book (Jews and Christians) split into seventy sects, and this religion will split into seventy three; seventy two will go in to the hell fire, and one of them will go to paradise, and it is the Jamaa`ah.&quot; (Abu Dawud, vol 3, Hadith #4580, English Translation)<br />
<br />
[ The term Jamaa`ah was explained by the companion `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood (radhiallaahu `anhu) as meaning that which agrees with the truth. He said in his famous statement, &quot;The jamaa`ah is that which agrees with the truth, even if it is a single person.&quot; (Reported by ibn Asaakir in Tareekh Dimashq - Arabic) ]<br />
<br />
Then there is no doubt that each of these groups claims for itself that it is the saved group, and that it is correct and that it alone follows the Messenger (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam), but the way of truth is a single way and it is the one which leads to salvation, and any other way is one of the ways of misguidance which leads to destruction as has been clearly explained by the Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) in another hadith, reported by the companion `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood (radhiallaahu `anhu), who said, &quot;Allaahís Messenger (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) drew a line with his hand and said, &quot;This is the straight path of Allaah.&quot; He then drew lines to its right and to its left and said, &quot;These are the other paths, which represent misguidance and that at the head of each path sat a devil inviting people to it (path).&quot; He then recited, &quot;And verily, this is My straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path.&quot; (Reported by Ahmad, an-Nasaaíee and ad-Daarimee and collected in Miskhaat ul-Masaabih, Vol 1, Hadith #166, Arabic-English Translation)<br />
<br />
So the path is to stick to the Book of Allaah and to the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam), as occurs in the following hadith. The Prophet (sallallaahu `alaihi wa sallam) said, &quot;I have left you with two things, as long as you hold to them, you will never go astray, they are the Book of Allaah and My Sunnah.&quot; (Collected by Imaam Maalik, rahimahullaah, in his Muwatta, the Book of Decree. Hadith #3, Page 434, English Translation)<br />
<br />
So the criterion to judge the claim of any group or individual who claims to be on the right path, is to see how close its beliefs and teachings are in accordance to the Quríaan and Sunnah.<br />
<br />
The external deceptive claim of the Naqshbandi group, under the guise of Islaam should not be a means of confusion to anybody, as to the reality of its deviant nature. History is a witness to the well-known slogan, &quot;If you cannot beat them, then join them&quot; - this is exactly what the group is doing. Its aim is to destroy Islaam from within, wearing the cloak of Islaam.<br />
<br />
A serious effort should be made to enlighten those of the groupís followers who may be genuinely seeking the light of pure Islaam, but as a result of the groupís brainwashing have fallen into its clutches.<br />
<br />
Whatever has been said in this booklet is not to be taken lightly, since this is a matter that could take a person completely outside of the fold of Islaam into Kufr (disbelief). This is not mere opinion of laymen but the verdict of the Ulamaaí of Islaam, who have pronounced anyone holding such weird beliefs, which contradict the very fundamentals of Islaamic belief, and continue to persist in such beliefs even after the evidence has been clearly shown to them, risks falling outside of the fold of Islaam. It should be kept in mind that the above statements are being made for conveying knowledge only and not to make declaration of Kufr (disbelief) of any people.<br />
<br />
It is compulsory on the `Ulamaaí to make an effort to inform the public through all means available about the groupís deviant nature. Articles exposing the group should be written and distributed. Many Muslims have passively sat by for a long time, believing that the group would soon fizzle out and disappear. Instead, its cancerous growth has continued unabated and unchecked. As for those who in spite of what they have read, continue to have misgivings about exposing the group due to their desire to maintain an image of unity with respect to Islaam, then let them reflect on the following incident, &quot;When some people mentioned to Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (rahimahullaah) that they felt uneasy about criticizing people (who had deviated in their beliefs), he replied - &quot;If I were to remain silent, how then would the masses know truth from falsehood?&quot; (Reported by Imaam Ibn Taymeeyah in Majmoo`ah ar-Rasaaíil wa al-Masaaíil, vol 4, Page 10, Arabic). According to the unanimous agreement of Muslim scholars, those who introduce deviant writings and religious rites, contrary to the Quríaan and Sunnah have to be exposed and the Muslim nation warned against them. In fact, when Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (rahimahullaah) was asked if one who fasted, prayed and secluded himself in the Masjid was dearer to him than one who spoke out against people involved in deviations, he replied, when one fasts, prays and secludes oneself, he does so for himself alone; but if he speaks out against deviations, he does so for Muslims in general, which is more noble.<br />

With this we end this article. After having read this article, if you believe it is your duty and responsibility to Allaah, to warn your brothers and sisters, then please do not be a silent spectator, spread the truth to the best of your ability. Perhaps you may save a soul or two from the deviant clutches of the group.<br />
<br />
Finally, we ask Allaah to give all of us the towfeeq to recognize the truth, to understand it, to implement it and to call to it.<br />
