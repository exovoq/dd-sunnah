<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">«·ÕÃ«Ã</div><div class="date">29-05-07, 10:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">May Allah forgive us all dear brother. I am not, by all means, the best guy for the task. There are plenty of other brothers and/or sisters here, whose English is by far better than mine. Nevertheless, I will furnish you with a humble work of translation, and pray that you deem it worthy of reading<br />
<br />
In the mean time, let me take this opportunity to invite any and all brethren to work on translating this fine letter of our Sheikh Ibnu Taymiyah [rah]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">«·ÕÃ«Ã</div><div class="date">05-06-07, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The letter of the Grand Sheikh of Islam Ibnu Taymiyah to his mother, in which he apologizes for staying in Egypt out of the necessity for teaching the people:<br />
<br />
He wrote, May the Mercy of Allah be upon him:<br />
<br />
From Ahmad bin Taymiyah to the auspicious mother, may Allah bless her with His bounties, bestow upon her His enormous munificence, and may He make her one of His best slaves and servants, may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon you.<br />
<br />
We hereby praise the Lord Allah, whom there is no god but He, who is worthy of all Praise, and who has power over all things. We ask Him to bestow His blessings on the seal of all prophets, and the head of all righteous, Muhammad, His servant and Messenger, May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his household.<br />
<br />
This, my letter to you, is about Allah&#8217;s great blessings, favors and benefactions, for which we praise Allah for, and ask Him for more. In fact, the blessings we receive from Allah are in constant increase and growth, and His bounties are far beyond numeration.<br />
<br />
As you know, my current stay in this region is due to important matters, if we are to neglect them, it will spoil our faith and life. And by Allah, it is not our choice to be distanced from you, for if it was possible for the birds to carry us, we would&#8217;ve come forth, but (as said) the absentee has his own excuse. In fact, if you were aware of the seriousness of the matter as it is, you would, with all praise to Allah, have no other choice but that. Nor did we ever plan to stay over even for a month. Rather, we&#8217;ve prayed to Allah to choose what is best for us and you, so pray likewise for us. May Allah the Exalted choose for us, yourself and the Muslims what is best for all.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, Allah has unleashed on us so much avenues of good, mercy, guidance and blessing that had never crossed our minds, nor did we ever think of. Yet, we constantly think of moving on, praying Allah [swt] to choose for us. So let no one ever think that we give a preference for any worldly matter over closeness to you. In fact, not even a religiously matter if your closeness has a preference over. But there are some serious matters, we fear, if neglected, may cause a particular and/or general negative effect, whereas the present assesses what the absent can&#8217;t assesses.<br />
What we ask of you eventually, is to pray much for us, for Allah knows, and we don&#8217;t. And Allah is able and we are not. He&#8217;s the Knower of all things Hidden. (Interestingly) The Messenger [saw] said: It&#8217;s to the pleasure of the man to ask Allah to choose for him, and be satisfied with what Allah has chosen for him. (On the other hand) It&#8217;s to his misfortune to neglect asking Allah to choose for him, and be dissatisfied with what He chooses for him.<br />
<br />
It may well happen that a merchant travels, and out of fear of lose he may choose to stay over to collect what is his due. Whereas what we are indulged in is beyond depiction. (Surely) There&#8217;s neither might nor power except by Allah. <br />
<br />
(In closing) May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon you abundantly, as well as on all those at home seniors and juniors, the rest of neighbors, family and friends each and every single one of them.<br />
<br />
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds, and peace &amp; blessings of Allah be on Muhammad, his household and companions.</div></div><hr />
