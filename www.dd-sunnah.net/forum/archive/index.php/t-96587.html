In the name of allah the most merciful , and peace be upon the prophet Muhammed<br />
    <br />
Happiness of the human being requires knowing some facts and treating them , and the happiness is following the human nature that God created us with , and to reach the right human nature it needs a right heart and a right brain , this can be achieved by following guidance of the Creator.<br />
  <br />
<br />
  <br />
One of the facts that human has to know is that the human is a weak creature, can easily be affected by emotions, events and people who lives with, and this is exploited by the devil to misguide the human from the right path , and to be strong enough we have to have a good faith that gives us support from God.<br />
  <br />
<br />
  <br />
And to protect this faith we have to avoid and desert what affects it as a bad society , that makes one confused and unable to have a good life , to a better society that helps one to live a good , comfortable life.<br />
  <br />
<br />
  <br />
 Advantages of living in a good islamic society:<br />
  <br />
<br />
  <br />
Allah said :îYou are the best ummah singled out for mankind: you enjoin what is right (maíroof), forbid what is wrong (munkar), and believe in Allah.î  . Surah al-Imran, ayah 110<br />
  <br />
<br />
  <br />
Allah said also: ìRepel (the evil) with one which is better (i.e. Allah ordered the faithful believers to be patient at the time of anger, and to excuse those who treat them badly), then verily! He, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend.î [Fussilat 41:34].<br />
  <br />
<br />
  <br />
The prophet (pbuh) said:îThe believers in their mutual kindness, compassion and sympathy are just like one body. When one of the limbs is afflicted, the whole body responds to it with wakefulness and fever.î [Al-Bukhari, Muslim and Ahmad].<br />
  <br />
<br />
  <br />
He also said :îThe merciful ones will be granted mercy from the Most Merciful. Have mercy on those on earth ñ the One above the heavens will then have mercy on you.î [At-Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud, and Ahmad. At-Tirmidhi graded this Hadith as sound and authentic].<br />
  <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
  <br />
1-feeling safety , and comfortable , less stressed.<br />
  <br />
2-feeling fellowship always and avoiding lonely and boredom , one always will find people who listen to him and help him.<br />
  <br />
3-expressing and sharing emotions and feelings with other people , like  happiness , sadness.<br />
  <br />
4-People guide, advice  and support each other .<br />
  <br />
5-Tolerance between people .<br />
  <br />
<br />
  <br />
And that leads to happiness in the whole life.<br />
  <br />

The decision of migration :<br />
  <br />
<br />
  <br />
Itís hard to leave a place we used to live in , our families , our friends , our work to a new place we didnít live in before , that makes decision to migrate hard but actually itís not a right way of thinking , and by comparing the good life we can find in migration with our current life we will find that migration is much  better <br />
  <br />
Allah said : ìWhoever migrates for the sake of Allah will find refuge and great bounty in the earthî at An-Nisa': 100<br />
  <br />
<br />
  <br />
Migration is a must :<br />
  <br />
<br />
  <br />
Allah said:îVerily! As for those whom the Angels have taken (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory to them), they (angels) asked them, &quot;In what condition were you?&quot;. They replied, &quot;We were weak and oppressed on earth&quot;. The Angels asked, &quot;Was not the earth of Allah spacious enough for you to migrate therein?&quot; Such men will find their abode in Hell - what an evil destination! Except the weak ones among men, women and children who were unable to devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their wayî An-Nisa': 97-98<br />
