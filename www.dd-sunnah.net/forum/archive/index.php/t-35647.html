<br />
As a labour of love for my fellow hammihan I have written this short and i hope readable account of an important and distinguisehd light of our past. <br />
<br />
Firouz Nahawandi <br />
<br />
Omar Ate My Liver- “Omar Jigar e Man ra Khord” <br />
<br />
Recounted from History of Abu Abbas AlBelAzaari <br />
<br />
Firouz Nahawandi was a distinguished officer of the Sassanian Army and was a former captive of Rome when he was captured by the Romans. Upon the defeat of the Romans and his freedom he was chosen to escort the captured daughter of the Roman Emperor, Katayoon, to Iran because it was a privileged role and further mark of the high esteem to which he was held. <br />
<br />
His army was defeated in the battle of Nahawand and after the defeat he fled to ATASHKADEH of Nahawand. The head of the victorious Arab Army sent him messages asking him is he was ready to become a believer. He replied, “I will give you all my wealth but let me keep my faith”. <br />
<br />
He prepared a treasure trove of Jewels and sent them to Kufah where Muavieyeh sold them to the Arab Trader “MAKHSOOMI” for 2 million dirhams and whom later sold the same goods back to Iranians for 4 million dirhams. <br />
<br />
Regardless he was taken captive and to Kufah in Chains. He is said to have seen a Caravan of around 3,000 captive Iranian Woman and Children and this had broken his heart when he stroked the hair of a young Girl and said to her <br />
<br />
“Omar has eaten my liver/ Ommar Jigar e man ra khordeh” <br />
<br />
This pain echoed in his heart and resounded upon seeing the slave market in Kufah where the Iranian women and Children were sold into Slavery by the thousand. Here in Kufah he made a fuss and caught the eye of Moavieyeh who approached him and asked him who he was and what he could do. Firouz Nahawandi explained his skills as a craftsman and as an Artisan whom knew the crafts of architecture, woodwork and ****************lwork. This impressed Moghayeh whom called Firouz Nahawandi the man with Gifted Hands and took him as a personal slave. <br />
<br />
Firouz Nahawandi was delighted because in him was rousing the taste to take revenge on Omar who had eaten his Liver. He gave Moghayreh good service so much so that Moghayereh asks him how much he will pay to Moghayereh each month if he frees him to go and work in the Taazi capital of Madinah. The high sum of 160,000 dirhams per month was agreed and Firouz accepted without delay because despite being a huge sum he wanted to get closer to Omar. Despite Omar’s decree that no Iranians were to be sent to Madinah, as Moghayireh was a good friend he convinced him that it would not be a danger to him and so Firouz left for Madinah with thoughts of avenging his stricken despair by killing Omar. <br />
<br />
Upon arriving in Madinah Omar contracted Firouz to build him a splendid Wind Catcher to which Firouz consented so he could earn Moghayereh’s fee. In this time Firouz Nahawandi manages to find a dagger, which a Christian lady whom he had befriended in Madinah gives to him. This lady was known as “Jofaeineh”. <br />
<br />
During the past forty days Firouz Nahawandi had been a frequent member of the congregation for prayers, which Omar lead so as to give the impression that he was a devout Moslem and to earn the trust of the congregation so much so that on the fortieth day he was able to secure a spot behind Omar in the prayer congregation. When Omar head was bowing to perform “Sajdeh” Firouz Launched at Omar and cut him from his Stomach to his Neck taking revenge for the countless Iranians whom Omar had killed and sold into slavery. <br />
<br />
Bel Azzari writes that the congregation whom were armed at all times, especially at prayer came for him but Firouz Flew past elegantly killing another 13-18 Arabs before being surrounded. Rather then be killed by the enemy this Legend cut his own chest. <br />
<br />
And so Firouz Nahawandi took revenge on behalf of Iranians against their primary tormentor Omar e Taazi and sent him to the place he had to go. <br />
