Racially-motivated murders on the rise<br />
By IRR News Team<br />
31 January 2008, 2:00pm<br />
Fifteen years since the death of Stephen Lawrence, there is less and less interest in the scourge of racial violence in the UK, despite murders remaining a major problem.<br />
Racial murders- unprovoked attacks on people not known to perpetrators - in the UK are running at around seven per year. Yet no official body is systematically monitoring their incidence, the police investigations, any prosecution or ultimate sentencing of attackers. Despite the lengthy Stephen Lawrence Inquiry, the seventy recommendations of the Macpherson Report, changes to the police's recording of racial incidents and an amended Race Relations Act, the Institute of Race Relations (IRR), a small, independent charity, remains the only organisation monitoring serious racial violence attacks in the UK.<br />
<br />
According to figures released by IRR this week, thirty-three racist murders have taken place between February 2003 and December 2007. Of these, all victims are male. Significantly, in the post-September 11 and 7/7 climate, forty per cent of the murders were of Muslims - either relatively recently-arrived asylum seekers or Pakistanis living or working in poor, deprived neighbourhoods. Asian men working in isolating professions such as cabbing or take-aways are particularly at risk - 15 per cent of the total.<br />
<br />
The IRR has a specific definition for identifying a racist attack or murder. It does not follow that BME people are always victims and Whites always perpetrators - though that covers by far the largest category of murders - 88 per cent. The latest research includes the death of Johnny Delaney, a 14-year-old Traveller boy, Kris Donald, 15, a White killed by an Asian gang in Pollockshields, Isiah Young-Sam killed during disturbances between Asians and African-Caribbeans in Birmingham in 2005 and a Polish migrant worker, Adam Michalski, killed in Wrexham. For IRR, identifying racially motivated murders and attacks 'must depend on an objective evaluation of the whole context in which the murder or attack takes place and not just on the skin colour or ethnicity of the alleged perpetrator(s) or victim. In particular, the IRR would regard a murder or attack as racially motivated if the evidence indicates that someone of a different ethnicity, in the same place and similar circumstances would not have been attacked in the same way...'* (See below for the IRR's definition)<br />
<br />
Look at one year. In 2007, Tarsen Nahar was found dead in Hayes in May, his assailant has been charged with racially aggravated actual bodily harm. Also in May, Marlon Moran was stabbed to death in Garston by a gang, following a campaign of racist abuse. His killer received a sentence of three-and-a-half years for manslaughter. In August, Adam Michalski was stabbed to death in a Wrexham street in what the judge said was an attack with a racial element. His assailant was sentenced to life, with a minimum 17-year term. An Indian sailor, Gregory Fernandes was attacked by a 20-strong gang in Fawley, and later died of his injuries, in what police termed a racial attack. In December, student Ahmed Hassan was stabbed in Dewsbury as he waited for a train to go shopping for Eid presents. Two people have been charged with his murder. Also in December, Asaf Mahmood Ahmed died after being attacked on his way to shops in Bolton. Police were treating it as a racially motivated attack. <br />
<br />
According to Harmit Athwal, who compiled the research for IRR, what is worrying is first that so little attention is given to the whole phenomenon. 'In recent years, other than Anthony Walker, who, except families of the deceased, can name one of these victims? And, second, unless racial motivation is absolutely unequivocal, judges are tending to rule out a racial element to these crimes and this is reflected in sentencing. What looks to us like violent, unprovoked murders are being downgraded to robberies that go wrong or manslaughters. Proven racial motivation of a murder could add substantially to the tariff. But that is rare indeed. Third, the public should realise how prevalent racial violence has become. Every week our news service reports at least three serious cases. There are probably more racial murders than we ever find out about.' <br />
<br />
The IRR is not funded to carry out research into racial violence, but has persevered for forty years at what is tantamount to a sleuthing job, so as to collate figures in the light of the lack of public scrutiny and concern. It trawls through hundreds of national and local papers and websites for reports of deaths. It then follows up incidents with local agencies - race equality councils, police forces, community groups, lawyers, the Crown Prosecution service, coroners, and journalists - to find out how a case continues. Again, developments may not even make local news. Occasionally, after the case has made IRR's records, family members may contact with more details. <br />
<br />
Cilius Victor, Trustee of the Newham Monitoring Project (NMP), who led a workshop on racial violence - 'Learning lessons from the past' - held at IRR on 25 January, commented: 'If IRR was not doing this research no one would know about these murders. It is truly shocking. NMP was set up after the murder of Akhtar Ali Baig in Newham in 1980. Twenty-eight years on, such street murders are yet more commonplace.'<br />
<br />
* The IRR considers that the identification of racially motivated murders and attacks must depend on an objective evaluation of the whole context in which the murder or attack takes place and not just on the skin colour or ethnicity of the alleged perpetrator(s) or victim. In particular, the IRR would regard a murder or attack as racially motivated if the evidence indicates that someone of a different ethnicity, in the same place and similar circumstances, would not have been attacked in the same way. Subject to the above, a formal legal finding or allegation of racial motivation would be taken as prima facie (but not definitive) evidence that a murder or attack was racially motivated.<br />
The Institute of Race Relations is precluded from expressing a corporate view: any opinions expressed are therefore those of the authors.<br />

Murder of Qatari student exposes the race hatred rife in Hastings<br />
By Chris Green<br />
Friday, 29 August 2008 <br />
<br />
<br />
To a young, ambitious and well-educated boy from a wealthy Middle Eastern family, the historic English seaside town of Hastings would seem an ideal place to spend six weeks learning English and about Britain.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hastings, 16-year-old Mohammed al-Majed knew, was where William the Conqueror defeated King Harold II in 1066. What better place to soak up British culture than where the seeds of the country's history were sown? <br />
<br />
The high number of foreign language schools in the area would undoubtedly have been another factor in Mohammed's decision to come to Hastings. With around 35,000 overseas students arriving there every year, he was almost certain to form some lasting friendships, and unlikely to be lonely or bored.<br />
<br />
Yet five weeks after his arrival in the UK, and a week before he was due to fly home to rejoin his family in Qatar, Mohammed al-Majed lay bleeding to death on a street corner, the victim of a racially motivated assault by a gang of white youths. He died in hospital the following day, alone, without a member of his family at his bedside.<br />
<br />
What Mohammed and his family did not realise when he set off for the UK is that every year an inordinately high number of race-related attacks are reported in Hastings, and that relations between the foreign language students and the locals are far from cordial.<br />
<br />
In the space of just three years, almost 100 foreign students have been attacked in the town, including physical assault and robbery, during April and August, when the language schools are busiest. Since many minor incidents are likely to go unreported, and the figures do not account for those who stay in Hastings at other times of the year, the real story could in fact be much worse.<br />
<br />
The leader of Hastings council's suggestion that the town was &quot;basically a safe and welcoming place&quot; for foreigners was yesterday met with derision by a group of Saudi Arabian students having lunch at a cafe just a few yards from the street corner where Mohammed al-Majed was murdered. <br />
<br />
Pandaris al-Ghandi, 32, arrived to study English at EF International Language School  the same school attended by Mohammed  six weeks ago, and returns to Saudi Arabia tomorrow. He says that after a few weeks in Hastings, he and his two brothers became too frightened to walk home at night in case they were attacked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Every time we walked past they would shout things,&quot; he says. &quot;Now I just take a taxi home with my brothers  they are both younger than me  because if we do not do that then we know that we will be hit or insulted. The problem is that there are groups of drunk young people and when they see that you are a foreigner or a stranger they start shouting bad words.&quot;<br />
<br />
He says that one of his brothers, who is the same age as Mohammed, was with him during the attack. He managed to escape by running away, but not before seeing him being kicked in the head by a group of seven white youths.<br />
<br />
A sudden drop in the number of overseas students arriving would be disastrous for the town's economy, so it was no surprise when community leaders declared that Hastings was still safe for foreign visitors. Michael Foster, the Labour MP for Rye and Hastings, admitted he was &quot;ashamed&quot; that the town might now be perceived as racist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Although Hastings is essentially a safe town with crime falling, the fact remains that this has happened on this occasion,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to recognise there are racist feelings among some members of our community, and they are unacceptable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yesterday, police on patrol walked past the two bouquets of flowers and the book of condolence which lay on one of the picnic tables outside the kebab shop where Mohammed was murdered. Inside was page after page of tributes from his fellow students.<br />
<br />
One read: &quot;We miss you already. We cannot explain how we feel, but God knows.&quot;<br />
<br />
A quick walk around the centre of Hastings is enough to establish that it is a far cry from the picturesque English seaside town that many foreign students might expect it to be. The once glamorous seafront, with its pebble beach and dilapidated pier, seems to have faded away into nothing, and the centre of town has become a pedestrianised wilderness with the usual smattering of familiar high street shops. <br />
<br />
The council has been keen for Hastings to shed its image as a downtrodden resort, and has ploughed millions of pounds into various rejuvenation projects. But these sparkling new building developments stare across at dingy and ageing tenements, giving a sense of a town with one foot in the future, but another firmly in the past. <br />
<br />
David Dyer, who works in a bar close to where Mohammed al-Majed was killed, has only lived in Hastings for three months, but has already witnessed a number of fights. He says that although he has seen worse tensions in his native Glasgow, the influx of foreign students definitely causes problems, to the extent that they will often leave the pubs early to avoid the locals.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is some animosity,&quot; he says. &quot;Usually between about eight and ten at night the students and the foreigners tend to leave, and then the English come in after them. They never really mix much.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's always one or two fights out by the kebab shop, where they all congregate. I'm a friend of the owner's, but if I wanted to I could guarantee getting into a fight just by going up there. Before I'd even set one foot inside the door I'd get in a fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Although there is undoubtedly a racial split within the town, many of the locals feel that the international students bring a richness and diversity to Hastings, as well as an important boost to the local economy. <br />
<br />
Joe Cruttenden, 28, has lived in the town all his life and said that it would be a &quot;stupid&quot; decision to chase the students out of the town, while another woman, who did not want to be named, said she had been renting rooms to foreign students for decades.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of the local residents that I know like having them here,&quot; she says. &quot;They bring a lot of money to the area, and a lot of life. We do have a lot of foreign language schools, but as far as I'm concerned it's an advantage for the town and I have no problem with it.&quot;<br />

<br />
A study of racial crime in London has found that one fifth of incidents involve neighbours, the Guardian can reveal. <br />
Reviewing more than 9,000 race related crimes that took place last year, researchers for the Metropolitan police study also discovered that more than 30% of all incidents ended with violence rather than threats, abuse or harassment. <br />

Importance of protecting our visitors<br />
Thursday 28th August 2008<br />
<br />
In a community still reeling from the murder of a 16-year-old foreign student, questions are now being asked about the safety of visitors to Sussex. Emily-Ann Elliott looks at the reasons why students are targeted as victims of crime and the importance of making sure they are protected. <br />
<br />
Outside a takeaway shop in Hastings, a book of condolence is being filled with messages for the family of 16-year-old Mohammed Al-Majed, from Qatar, who died after being attacked by local youths. <br />
<br />
Other Arab students, many who have visited the town before to study English, express shock and distress that this could happen to a friend. <br />
<br />
Some have already said they will not return to the town as they and their families feel too frightened. <br />
<br />
Sultan Al-Dossary, from Saudi Arabia, said after hearing the news his parents wanted him to return home immediately. <br />
<br />
He said: This is a dangerous place. I will not be coming back. <br />
<br />
As well as being bad for the UKs relations with other countries, these fears could have a negative effect on the economies of towns such as Hastings, where foreign students contribute up to £35 million to the local economy every year. <br />
<br />
Councillor Peter Pragnell, the leader of Hastings Borough Council, said: Students are a vital part of our economy and we have somewhere between 30,000 and 35,000 every year. <br />
<br />
With this figure in mind, incidents of violence against students are very, very low and we must not forget that. <br />
<br />
Racism and violence will not be tolerated in Hastings and we will do everything in our power to prevent incidents such as this happening again. <br />
<br />
My thoughts are with Mohammeds family and friends at this sad time. <br />
<br />
There are more than 20 language schools in Hastings alone and many other towns across Sussex play host to students from all over the world in the summer months. <br />
<br />
While Sussex Police has reported the number of crimes against students in Hastings is down year on year, between April 1 and August 26 this year, 30 crimes have been recorded against foreign language students. <br />
<br />
Of those, 12 were assaulted and four robbed. <br />
<br />
In 2007, 32 crimes were reported, including 13 assaults and two robberies and in 2006, there were 36 crimes, 16 assaults and five robberies. <br />
<br />
The other offences were mainly thefts. <br />
<br />
Michael Foster, MP for Hastings and Rye, said: Its important to say that Hastings is essentially a safe place for visitors. <br />
<br />
Violent crime, attacks and indeed incidents involving foreign students have plummeted in recent times, which makes the tragedy involving Mohammed so exceptional. <br />
<br />
Its important that both visitors to our town and ethnic groups who are now living here and part of our local community feel safe and secure. <br />
<br />
A meeting was held yesterday at Hastings Town Hall with Mr Foster, councillors, police and student leaders and representatives from ethnic groups to discuss the safety of students. <br />
<br />
Mr Foster said: We cannot overlook the fact that foreign investment through the language schools and into the local college are significant contributors to our local economy. <br />
<br />
Its also the case that in recent times crime, particularly violent crime, has fallen dramatically, as have offences involving overseas students. <br />
<br />
This weekends tragic incident, therefore, is out of character with the way that the town is developing. <br />
<br />
Mohammed was murdered less than 100 yards away from Robertson Street, where a German teenager was punched and kicked in the face by a hoodie in an unprovoked attack last April. <br />
<br />
Earlier this month, two 17-year-old German students were kicked and spat at by a group of teenage girls as they walked through the Meridian Centre, Peacehaven. <br />
<br />
In July, a 17-year-old student from the Czech Republic was beaten unconscious by a group of six youths at Haywards Heath railway station. He suffered a broken ankle. <br />
<br />
In previous years, foreign students have also been targeted in Brighton, where a Chinese student was threatened at knifepoint and robbed on the beach off Madeira Drive in 2004 and a student from China was punched in the mouth when two teenagers stole her phone in 2003. <br />
<br />
Dr Alana Lentin, a senior lecturer in sociology at the University of Sussex, is an expert on racism and has written two books on the subject. <br />
<br />
She said: This isnt a new issue but in a place like Hastings the majority of the population has been, until recently, white. <br />
<br />
People in Hastings have seen a big increase in people from different backgrounds moving in, whether they are migrant workers or students. <br />
<br />
However, what I think is new is the rhetoric being bandied about against multi-culturalism. <br />
<br />
When you hear your Prime Minister impose national values over multi-culturalism it is sending a strong message to all citizens of the UK  that anyone who doesnt live by our rules, we have the right to be against and people feel legitimate in their actions. <br />
<br />
This kind of overriding discourse that we shouldnt be promoting multi-culturalism is not only coming from the bottom up. <br />
<br />
Education is one of the things needed to change this but for me the main thing that needs to change is discourse that comes down from the top. In places like Hastings what has to happen is meetings between people of different backgrounds. <br />
<br />
On one hand you might have migrants who may not have very good English but are also fearful of a new place and on the other hand you have local people being distrustful of what is coming into their community. <br />
<br />
Funding needs to be put in place in so they can be put in contact with each other. <br />
<br />
As human beings they will probably have more in common than they think. Only fear comes from the unknown. <br />
<br />
Dr Lentin added that as a result of global issues and media portrayals, people from countries such as Qatar are often viewed in a different way to those from European countries. <br />
<br />
She said: We assume that if somebody is a young male Arab, speaking Arabic or looking a certain way, they are racially perceived as some kind of threat. <br />
<br />
We dont see them in the same was as we see students from, say, Spain, and we need to ask why. <br />

Get rid of racism in Hastings, say community leaders<br />
<br />
Date: <br />
28 August 2008 <br />
By Observer <br />
Community leaders have vowed to stamp out racism in Hastings.<br />
Language school managers, ethnic minority leaders, police, local politicians and student representatives attended a meeting at the Town Hall this morning (Thurs) following the death of Mohammed Al-Majed.<br />
<br />
Speaking at a press conference afterwards, Hastings MP Michael Foster spoke of his shame about the racist attack that led to Mohammed's death.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are some people in Hastings who are racist. I think they are a small minority but there is a significant number of people who misunderstand the contribution those from other lands bring to our community.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are united in the belief that they are wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
He added: &quot;I feel ashamed this has happened. What we do know is that there were racist overtones. This is exceptional as Hastings is essentially a safe town.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hastings Borough Council leader Peter Pragnell described the meeting of community leaders as &quot;fruitful&quot; and said the council was targeting racism under a Community Cohesion Action Plan already underway.<br />
<br />
&quot;We cannot control the way people think but we can re-educate by suggesting ways people can get involved in the community,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a small ethnic population in Hastings but it covers nearly 100 different nationalities and in the main we live together in harmony. This tragic death should not detract from that entirely.&quot;<br />
<br />
He added: &quot;Even though this is a very tragic death, Hastings is a safe and welcoming place for residents and visitors, whether they are tourists, holidaymakers or foreign language students.&quot;<br />
<br />
Det Chief Insp Mark Ling said Sussex Police was treating the case as &quot;a top priority&quot; and the investigation was currently focusing on identifying eye witnesses.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have no evidence to suggest that he was stamped on or kicked in a frenzied attack. He received a head injury that was consistent that he hit his head,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
He told the press conference that Mohammed was initially kept inside a police vehicle while officers dealt with the fracas, before transferring him to an ambulance.<br />
<br />
DCI Ling said he understood the ambulance had arrived at the scene &quot;in a matter of minutes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Witnesses are asked to contact police on 0845 6070999 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.<br />
<br />
- A memorial event for Mohammed will be held in Priory Meadow shopping centre on Monday at 11am.<br />
<br />
Everyone is invited to attend and take part in two minutes' silence.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ãÚÊãÏ</div><div class="date">30-08-08, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On Saturday morning, exactly a week ago, a young foreign student called Mohammed Al-Majed sat in an English hospital bed, his dark head swathed in a bandage, to receive a number of visitors. <br />
<br />
The 16-year-old English language student spoke a few polite words in his native Arabic, thanking all of them, including his landlord, Trevor, in the seaside resort of Hastings, East Sussex, for coming to see him.<br />
<br />
No one who gathered there, least of all Trevor, expected the handsome teenager to die.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Heartbreaking: The once popular resort is a 'town in meltdown'<br />
<br />
'He looked pale, but I thought he was recovering. Everyone there believed the same thing,' said Trevor today at his terrace house near the town centre, where Mohammed and two other students had rented rooms for a two-week language course. <br />
<br />
Yet, tragically, later on Saturday, an ambulance rushed Mohammed from the Hastings' Conquest Hospital to a specialist unit at King's College Hospital in London, where he lapsed into a coma and never regained consciousness. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
More...<br />
'Find our son's killers': Plea by family of Arab student killed in race attack <br />
<br />
A post mortem examination found that he had died of a brain injury. The night before, on the seafront, he had been chased by a gang of white youths in what police say was a racist attack, which ended with him striking his head on the pavement.<br />
<br />
Just what happened in the crucial seconds before that is now the subject of a police murder inquiry.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
Brutally killed: Mohammed Al-Majed<br />
<br />
What is known is that the youths, drunk on cans of cheap supermarket lager, shouted abusive names at Mohammed, including Osama Bin Laden and 'terrorist scum', after confronting him on the seafront and forcing him to run for his life.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, his distraught father  - a multimillionaire jeweller in the Middle Eastern oil state of Qatar, who flew his son's body home for burial this week  -  wants to know why such a dreadful thing happened. <br />
<br />
He is also asking questions about how the once gentle resort of Hastings has turned into a seedy place of such violence, criminality, drug and alcohol abuse that it is not only shaming to Britain, but a danger to the young foreigners who study there in their tens of thousands each summer. <br />
<br />
This week, it emerged that over the past three years, there have been 41 attacks on foreign students, 11 of them robberies. <br />
<br />
<br />
Shockingly, there have been 16 assaults on women in the town over the same period. <br />
<br />
In the local courts this week, the litany of cases is as depressing as ever: a 69-year-old male pensioner facing a charge of raping a 13-year-old boy, a mother of two toddlers put on curfew for harassing another woman over their shared boyfriend... No wonder the local newspaper asked: 'What the hell is going on in Hastings?' <br />
<br />
Just 50 years ago, Hastings, with its pebbley beaches and wide promenade, was the third most popular tourist resort in the country  -  after Blackpool and Brighton. <br />
<br />
A century before, it was the favourite bathing resort of the Victorians, who started going on holiday there when the railway from London opened in the mid-19th century. <br />
<br />
<br />
A famous monument commemorating Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria, was built in the town because the couple loved this part of the coast so much. <br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
Remzi Tanriverdi: His kebab shop is on the battle frontline <br />
<br />
Before that, the Georgians came here to 'take the waters', leaving their mark on the town by building a breathtaking array of beautiful houses. <br />
<br />
Even now the town, which is spread up a hillside overlooking the sea, is a place of stunning architectural beauty, with tall houses adorned with fine ****************l balconies, above cobbled streets and handsome squares. <br />
<br />
Yet this lovely vista belies the truth. As tourism has dwindled, the town has turned to other things to make ends meet: notably, selling itself as a centre for English languages courses.<br />
<br />
Nearly 40,000 foreign students come to Hastings between March and October, swelling the population of the town by half. <br />
<br />
 <br />
Fellow foreign students leave messages of sympathy outside the kebab shop for Mohammed<br />
<br />
<br />
They arrive from all over the world, but a vast number are young men from the Middle East. <br />
<br />
They are lured by the fine words on the town's language-school brochures on the internet. <br />
<br />
<br />
They promise that the students will study in a town of old-fashioned charm, where the most famous battle in English history was fought in 1066. <br />
<br />
The young students are offered accommodation, living with host parents who will talk about English culture while serving their young guests evening meals and a hearty breakfast.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
Mohammed's parents have demanded justice for their son<br />
<br />
'Hastings is an historic town, with a wealth of facilities and attractions, in an area of the south coast known as the birthplace of England,' boasts one such brochure. <br />
<br />
'It is home to Europe's largest fishing fleet and has the first Norman castle in England.<br />
<br />
'Few other towns can boast of such varied and interesting historical attractions.' <br />
<br />
Yet the truth is that Hastings is a very different place from the one portrayed in the brochures. It is, to be brutally honest, a town in meltdown. <br />
<br />
The problems began two decades ago when the London boroughs began to encourage their underprivileged, their jobless, their refugees and general down-and-outs to live there. <br />
<br />
It was a deal the once-proud resort welcomed: with fewer tourists they had empty hotels aplenty, which were promptly turned into social housing units. <br />
<br />
Today, Hastings is paying the price for this disastrous decision. The rate of crime, particularly violent attacks, thefts and sex offences, is far higher than the national average. <br />
<br />
<br />
It is officially listed among the 30 most deprived areas in England. It suffers, maintains the town's own regeneration report, from low schooling success, and one in three of the employable population has no skills whatsoever.<br />
<br />
One in nine of the town's adults are on benefit, a figure that rivals the jobless blackspots in the north-east and is the worst in the south-east of England. <br />
<br />
Ten per cent of the working population claim income support because their wages are so low, and a third of all local children are being brought up in households with so little money that their lives are blighted by poverty, according to the Government's own figures. <br />
<br />
The jobless tally in Hastings is 50 per cent higher than the south east as a whole, health problems are worse here than in much of the rest of the country and it has the biggest proportion of old people anywhere in Britain. <br />
<br />
More than 5,000 of the enormous number of elderly in Hastings claim the Government's pension credit because they have so little income. <br />
<br />
<br />
Most of them remember the heydays of the town, when jobs abounded and every train from London brought another group of tourists. <br />
<br />
'Now we lock our doors at night,' said Alice, an 86-year-old who has arrived on her mobile wheelchair to have baked beans on toast at The Club coffee bar in the main square. <br />
<br />
'When I was in my 60s, I used to sit out on the promenade in the evening, or play bowls in the park with friends. You wouldn't dream of that today,' she adds, sadly. <br />
<br />
The results of this breakdown of society are plain to see. <br />
<br />
Go out into the parks at nine in the morning, and the drunks are already downing tins of lager and bottles of cider.<br />
<br />
A few hours later, the drug addicts sit on the pavements in the town centre, openly and aggressively begging for money to buy their way into another day of oblivion. <br />
<br />
No wonder Middle Eastern students, lured by the glossy brochures, are astonished at what they find here. <br />
<br />
'It is like living in the Wild West,' says Jama Mahavi, a 43-year- old Iranian who came to Britain as a refugee two decades ago. <br />
<br />
<br />
He runs a language school and computer centre in the town and has watched it spiral into decline. <br />
<br />
'We have to advise the foreign students not to go out after eight at night, never to walk in the streets alone and not to make eye contact with anyone as they go from their host homes to classes. <br />
<br />
'They are terrified when they find out what is happening here. They think of England as somewhere safe and civilised. <br />
<br />
<br />
'They ask me: &quot;Can this really be happening?&quot; What is more, I promise you that every day the behaviour of the yobs and drop-outs gets worse.' <br />
<br />
He is, undoubtedly, right. Just a glimpse at some of the local paper headlines tells the story: gangs of youths throwing a block of concrete through the window of a nurse's car; a firework pushed through the letterbox of a family living near the town centre; and a glass bottle hurled at a woman taxi driver ferrying a passenger at the time. <br />
<br />
Remzi Tanriverdi, 43, is not surprised about this. <br />
<br />
<br />
He is on the battle frontline. He runs a kebab cafe and bar overlooking the seafront. <br />
<br />
<br />
It is popular with the foreign students  -  they can play pool in the back room or sit on sofas drinking tea and chatting. In troubled Hastings, it appears a safe haven. <br />
<br />
Yet Remzi says that his kebab house has been attacked by gangs of local youths 25 times. <br />
<br />
<br />
'There is a group who are persistent troublemakers in Hastings. They have no respect for others and if they are not drunkards, then they are drug addicts. <br />
<br />
<br />
I know their names, everyone in the town does. They are layabouts and are jealous of the money that these Arab kids have.' <br />
<br />
He adds: 'The foreign students are polite people. They are shocked by what they find in England. <br />
<br />
<br />
'Many from the Middle East do not have a drinking culture and they are not used to this violence. <br />
<br />
<br />
'Now there must be a big question mark over the future of Hastings as a place to come and study.' <br />
<br />
It was outside this kebab house last Friday at 11.30pm that Mohammed, who was talking to friends in a crowd of 30 or 40 foreign students, was first accosted. <br />
<br />
His friends say that he was chased, caught, and then kicked in the head without mercy until he was unconscious. <br />
<br />
<br />
Others remember the chase, but insist that it ended not with a brawl but with Mohammed falling to the ground and banging his head on the pavement. <br />
<br />
<br />
Whatever the truth, Remzi says that the atmosphere at his kebab house had already begun to get nasty a little earlier in the evening. <br />
<br />
A group of youths, two girls among them, arrived with their own cans of strong lager bought from the supermarket and sat on the benches outside the entrance. <br />
<br />
<br />
He told them to move on because they had not bought their drinks from him. <br />
<br />
'I recognised two of the boys. They are white, almost always drunk and one has just come out of prison. <br />
<br />
<br />
'Last Friday, the group refused to go away and swaggered into my kebab house with their cans of lager. <br />
<br />
<br />
'They walked up to the pool table and began to play. One spilt his drink over the table and a few minutes later dropped his glass on the floor, where it broke. <br />
<br />
'I said I was closing for the night. I cleared the whole area and began to clean up as though it was the end of the evening. I was just pretending, of course, to get rid of them.' <br />
<br />
The events of the next half hour cast a new shadow over an already troubled Hastings.<br />
<br />
The gang of youths walked out of the kebab house and came face to face with Mohammed and his friend, Peter Henworth, a 17-year-old Nigerian student who has lived in the town for five years. <br />
<br />
Peter recalls: 'They came up to me and Mohammed and said: &quot;What's your problem.&quot; We tried to move away, we didn't want any grief. They were swearing and aggressive.' <br />
<br />
As the youths began to push them backwards, Mohammed and Peter turned and ran. Mohammed pounded along the pavement towards the Pig In Paradise, a pub 50 yards away. <br />
<br />
<br />
Peter raced over the road to the promenade. The gang chose to follow Mohammed. <br />
<br />
According to Peter: 'I kept on running and then, from the promenade, watched what was happening to Mohammed over on the other side of the road. <br />
<br />
<br />
'The gang caught up with him and he fell to the ground. They kicked him again and again until he stopped moving altogether. <br />
<br />
'I crossed over from the promenade and went back to the kebab house. When I got there the gang arrived leaving Mohammed where he was along the road. <br />
<br />
<br />
'They went up to one of his friends, a 15-year-old boy from Saudi Arabia called Mojeb, and hit him over the head with a glass. He needed six stitches.' <br />
<br />
This week, the police interviewed four local men, two aged 18, one 17, and one 20, bailing them while further inquiries are made. <br />
<br />
<br />
But that is little consolation to Mojeb. Sitting outside the kebab house, I asked him what he thought of England. <br />
<br />
'I am frightened,' he said simply in faltering English. 'I just want to go home. <br />
<br />
'I have told my father what happened to my friend, Mohammed. As for my mother, I have not dared tell her the truth about my visit to your country. If I did, it would break her heart.' <br />
<br />
Indeed, the tragedy of Hastings is all too heartbreaking. For this town so steeped in history and the site of the most famous battle on English soil, is no longer the glorious tourist attraction that it has been for centuries. <br />
<br />
Today, the people of Hastings are fighting another battle  -  against a pernicious and often racist underclass. And the truth is, they are losing.<br />

The public misconception is that the UK is a safe country and the US violent, but the truth is just the opposite. Depending on which numbers you choose, the violent crime rate in the UK is five times higher than the rate in the US.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ãÚÊãÏ</div><div class="date">31-08-08, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Observer view - one week after racist tragedy rocks Hastings<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
« Previous « PreviousNext » Next »View GalleryWELL, what a week it has been. A truly shocking one for Hastings, and sadly, of course, a tragic one for the family and friends of Mohammed Al-Majed.<br />
<br />
Here was a young man from Qatar who had been in Hastings for just five weeks, enjoying a Friday night out with friends when tragedy struck. It remains unclear exactly what happened but he was clearly punched - not stamped on and beaten to death as ADVERTISEMENTwas reported earlier in the week - and fell to the ground, causing his skull to fracture. He was placed in a police van for his own safety, taken to hospital, and died two days later in London.<br />
<br />
As the police investigation continues, and the national press batter Hastings once again, sadly a number of questions remain unanswered:<br />
<br />
First, just how safe are the streets of Hastings? Safe, say the police. <br />
Safe, say our MP and council leader. Unsafe, say many local residents. There have been 100 reported crime incidents relating to foreign students in the past three years. Mohammed clearly felt unsafe. He had told friends two weeks ago he feared for his own safety.<br />
<br />
Second, why did it take the NHS FIFTEEN hours to find him a bed in a specialist London hospital? The scan was completed at 4am Saturday. A bed became available at 7pm that evening in Kings. No wonder the family is accusing the NHS of being negligent.<br />
<br />
Third, is EF Language School happy that their young students - aged just 16 - are roaming the streets at close to midnight? That doesn't sound responsible to me at all. No wonder the family is outraged.<br />
<br />
Next, what about the police? Have they done all they can to reassure the public after the tragedy? In a word, no. They failed to release any information until almost 72 hours after the attack. They failed to inform the borough council what had happened - the council found out via the media. They conducted a press conference on Tuesday morning which was nothing short of a shambles. And on Thursday they chose one of their officers for a crucial press conference who had to admit he wasn't even part of the police investigation team. Sussex Police PR on this has been a disgrace. The chief constable, or one of his deputies, should have been in Hastings on Tuesday morning, in front of the television cameras, to speak to residents and tell them this was an isolated incident. We were left with a DCI, which frankly isn't good enough.<br />
<br />
Many people are also puzzled why the police haven't yet spoken to some of the witnesses who have spoken freely to the media. One of Mohammed's friends told us he knew the identity of one of those responsible - he said if there was an identity parade of one million people he could pick out the face of the attacker. So why haven't Sussex Police done that? It can't take that long to set up an ID parade.<br />
<br />
The owner of the kebab shop claims he has been attacked 25 times, yes 25 times. One would hope that he has reported at least some of the attacks to the police, but what are officers doing about that? Twenty-five attacks against one shop owner is appalling.<br />
<br />
And finally what about society, what about the people who hold such racist attitudes and commit such shocking crimes?<br />
<br />
Council leader Peter Pragnell met with community chiefs yesterday, and he said there was a clear message that education is the key. We need to teach people that racism is wrong, and hopefully the two-minute silence on Monday in Priory Meadow will send out such a message.<br />
<br />
Our MP was clear. Hastings is not a racist town, but we have a racial element within our town, as no doubt there is everywhere.<br />
<br />
Racism is a shocking disease that blights society.<br />
<br />
It has been a truly, truly shocking week.<br />

To Mr. Peter Lindsey, Editor<br />
<br />
I would like to thank you for your view about the tragic murder of the Qatari young student Mohamed Almajed I condemn this racial crime and<br />
I Quote<br />
As well as being bad for the UKs relations with other countries, these fears could have a negative effect on the economies of towns such as Hastings, where foreign students contribute up to £35 million to the local economy every year. <br />
<br />
Councillor Peter Pragnell, the leader of Hastings Borough Council, said: Students are a vital part of our economy and we have somewhere between 30,000 and 35,000 every year. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Your sincerely<br />

Observer view - one week after racist tragedy rocks Hastings<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
........<br />
the police investigation continues, and the national press batter Hastings once again, sadly a number of<br />
<br />
 questions remain unanswered:<br />
<br />
First, just how safe are the streets of Hastings? Safe, say the police. <br />
Safe, say our MP and council leader. Unsafe, say many local residents. There have been 100 reported crime incidents relating to foreign students in the past three years. Mohammed clearly felt unsafe. He had told friends two weeks ago he feared for his own safety.<br />
<br />
Second, why did it take the NHS FIFTEEN hours to find him a bed in a specialist London hospital? The scan was completed at 4am Saturday. A bed became available at 7pm that evening in Kings. No wonder the family is accusing the NHS of being negligent.<br />
<br />
Third, is EF Language School happy that their young students - aged just 16 - are roaming the streets at close to midnight? That doesn't sound responsible to me at all. No wonder the family is outraged.<br />
<br />
Next, what about the police? Have they done all they can to reassure the public after the tragedy? In a word, no. They failed to release any information until almost 72 hours after the attack. They failed to inform the borough council what had happened - the council found out via the media. They conducted a press conference on Tuesday morning which was nothing short of a shambles. And on Thursday they chose one of their officers for a crucial press conference who had to admit he wasn't even part of the police investigation team. Sussex Police PR on this has been a disgrace. The chief constable, or one of his deputies, should have been in Hastings on Tuesday morning, in front of the television cameras, to speak to residents and tell them this was an isolated incident. We were left with a DCI, which frankly isn't good enough.<br />
<br />
Many people are also puzzled why the police haven't yet spoken to some of the witnesses who have spoken freely to the media. One of Mohammed's friends told us he knew the identity of one of those responsible - he said if there was an identity parade of one million people he could pick out the face of the attacker. So why haven't Sussex Police done that? It can't take that long to set up an ID parade.<br />
<br />
The owner of the kebab shop claims he has been attacked 25 times, yes 25 times. One would hope that he has reported at least some of the attacks to the police, but what are officers doing about that? Twenty-five attacks against one shop owner is appalling.<br />
<br />
And finally what about society, what about the people who hold such racist attitudes and commit such shocking crimes?<br />
<br />
Council leader Peter Pragnell met with community chiefs yesterday, and he said there was a clear message that education is the key. We need to teach people that racism is wrong, and hopefully the two-minute silence on Monday in Priory Meadow will send out such a message.<br />
<br />
Our MP was clear. Hastings is not a racist town, but we have a racial element within our town, as no doubt there is everywhere.<br />
<br />
Racism is a shocking disease that blights society.<br />
<br />
It has been a truly, truly shocking week.<br />
<br />

POLICE dealt with a fracas on Friday night outside the kebab shop where exactly a week earlier a fight resulted in the death of foreign student Mohammed Al-Majed.<br />
<br />
Four people are to appear in court in connection with the latest incident, one charged with a racially motivated public order offence.<br />
<br />
Officers had been in the area of the Kebab Hut and Pizza Shop at the junction of Robertson Street until after midnight as part of an anniversary operation to trace more witnesses to the assault on Mohammed.<br />
<br />
About an hour after that finished a disturbance broke out when two young women tried to enter the kebab shop, which runs a night-time club.<br />
<br />
Inspector Martin Mann told the Observer: &quot;At about 1.50am there was an incident in the kebab shop during which the doors were damaged, racist comments were allegedly made, and police officers were obstructed and assaulted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two local females, aged 17 and 20, were arrested and two local males, aged 22 and 34, who intervened were also arrested.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were interviewed the following morning in relation to the incident and between them they have been charged with a total of eight offences, one of which is a racially motivated public order offence.<br />
<br />
&quot;The other charges include criminal damage, assaulting police, obstructing police and resisting arrest.&quot;<br />
<br />
The four will appear at Hastings Magistrates Court on Wednesday September 10.<br />

A resident's view of the past two weeks after race attack<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
« Previous « PreviousNext » Next »View GalleryHERE is a letter from Carol Emery on the troubles of Hastings:<br />
Firstly like all parents the loss of child is our worst nightmare, and my sympathy is with Mohammed's parents.<br />
<br />
Here we go again the national press are having a field-day once again attacking Hastings - they published in the Daily Mail a picture ofADVERTISEMENTa run down building which was several years out of date - shock tactics to the rest of the country and the world - come on give us a chance! <br />
<br />
Hastings is trying very hard to improve its image with a massive regeneration programme, and is really no different to any other large town in this country suffering from groups of people who think anti-social and racialist behaviour is the 'fashion' and makes them look and feel big.<br />
<br />
I have been involved with the foreign student industry in this town for over 20 years firstly as a host myself and latterly as a local organiser for many groups visiting the town from Europe. I do wish the press would not continue to class all host families as uncaring and greedy - yes! there are a few people out there who are only in it for the money and make it quite clear to their guests - BUT the majority are welcoming, caring and happy to welcome these young people and consider their wellbeing during their stay and send them home with lasting memories of their stay in Hastings. <br />
<br />
It concerns me that Mohammed's family were obviously unconcerned at the late hour he was roaming the town, and what about EF dont they have 'ground rules' with regard to times students should return home in the evening.<br />
<br />
While I am aware there are some unpleasant, unwelcoming people in this town we should also consider the incident from another viewpoint - students on the whole are well behaved and happy to be in Hastings, but unfortunately on occasions, as all Language School will say there can be a disruptive element who aggravate our local kids - thus causing the type of confrontation that occurred on the night in question. <br />
<br />
Mohammed like many students come to England because their families can afford to send them; while they are here they 'brag' to their fellow students of their affluence often loudly and in earshot of the residents of Hastings - need I say anymore - jealously is one of the deadliest sins and can be the cause of many battles.<br />
<br />
This is a good town with a lot to offer visitors from all over the world; language schools offer excellent English courses with great support from teams of teachers,activity leaders, welfare officers and local organisers - the business brings a great deal of money into this town and I for one am sick of the national press taking any opportunity to have a go at us.<br />

The uncle then paid tribute to Mohammed, describing him as &quot;so sweet, so tender, so peaceful&quot;.<br />

The family of Mohammed Al-Majed have urged foreign students not to stop visiting Hastings after being overwhelmed by the reaction of local people.<br />
In the immediate aftermath of the 16-year-old's tragic death one uncle criticised the town and said the English language student had already been fearful of attack prior to his death.<br />
<br />
Ghazi Abdullah Al-Majed, the uncle, then said he would be telling other Arab families not to send their children to Hastings.<br />
<br />
However, following their visit to Hastings on Monday during which a delegation of Mohammed's family visited the site of his death, a second uncle has spoken out in support of the town.<br />
<br />
Abdul Karim Mohsin spoke to The Observer after meeting with representatives from Sussex Police and local politicians at the Town Hall.<br />
<br />
In an emotional interview Mohammed's uncle, who himself studied in England, said: &quot;We have been overwhelmed by the sympathy, warmth and support we have received from the community here in Hastings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, I was amazed. I did not expect Hastings' feelings to be so high. The impression given initially about Hastings was that such problems (racism) still existed here.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don't believe British society is full of hatred. For many generations, and centuries, many ethnic groups regardless of race and colour have lived here in harmony.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't advice people to stay away from Hastings. I believe apart from educational we have a history of a political relationship and a lot of our people are living here in peace and a lot of Britain's live in the Middle East.<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely, without doubt or hesitation I would say foreign students should still visit Hastings.&quot;<br />
<br />
The uncle then paid tribute to Mohammed, describing him as &quot;so sweet, so tender, so peaceful&quot;.<br />
<br />
He then offered a heartfelt message. He said: &quot;On behalf of the Al Majed family, and indeed of behalf of all our countrymen, we would like to thank the people of Hastings.<br />

Tourism chief criticises news coverage of Mohammed's death<br />

The tourism boss at Hastings Borough Council has hit out at what he calls &quot;unfair&quot; journalism which is damaging the town's reputation.<br />
Kevin Boorman, the Council's marketing manager, spoke out about his dismay at national newspapers' coverage of the tragic death of Mohammed Al-Majed.<br />
<br />
He says the deluge of negative press which has flooded into the national media since the attack on Mohammed's has &quot;put back Hastings reputation a decade.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tourism bigwig is now worried the bad press and subsequent damage to Hastings reputation could see tourists from both the UK and abroad turn their back on the town.<br />
<br />
This would be hugely damaging to the local economy.<br />
<br />
Hastings is visited by 35,000 foreign students every year - an influx of youngsters which generates more than £35million in cash here in 1066 Country.<br />
<br />
On top of that another 55,000 foreign visitors flock to Hastings and St Leonards on holiday keen to experience a quintessential English seaside town and an area rich in history. This group contributes another £22million in local business.<br />
<br />
As well as those coming from overseas Hastings welcomes 2.6million day visitors and a further 366,000 staying tourists from within the UK - the later spending £46million a year.<br />
<br />
This means that although foreign visitors only account for one in eight staying tourists they contribute almost a third of the cash generated.<br />
<br />
The average UK staying visitor spends £127 per stay compared to the average foreign tourist who spends £397 each.<br />
<br />
These figures, according to Mr Boorman, show exactly why Hastings cannot afford to see this positive coverage turn into a dip in tourism trade for the town.<br />
<br />
Mr Boorman said: &quot;I first heard the tragic news of the death of Mohammed Al Majed at lunchtime on Bank Holiday Monday. I was having lunch with my family, including two teenage boys just a few months younger than Mohammed, and I couldn't start to imagine how I would feel if I I'd learnt that anything had happened to my children while they were away studying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately my instinct was that this was just the beginning of the story.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Sun's 'Battle of Hatings' piece on Thursday, the 'Murder of Qatari student exposes the race hatred rife in Hastings' in the Independent on Friday, and the two page horror spread in the Mail were all predictable.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's my job to read such rubbish, unfortunately, and doing my job you think I'd get used to it. But those articles, particularly the Mail one, really got to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;It absolutely incenses me that newspapers are using the tragic dearth of a 16-year-old boy to sell papers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not saying Hastings is perfect, goodness me I know that's not true, but when I stop and look around, I just do not recognize the place described with such venom by those out of town hacks.<br />
<br />
&quot;The danger is, some people do actually believe what they read, and the one-sided, unbalanced articles actually do do damage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our economy depends on visitors, and we do need to attract new businesses here, and so the reputational harm is immense.&quot;<br />

Posted by: afridi <br />
A 16 year old named Mohammed-al-Majed was killed by a suspected racist gang in surrey last week. The 16 year old was injured by a gang outside a takeaway restaurant on Friday. He was taken to hospital but later died because of the head injuries next day. Before calling it a shameful incident I will like to add something before condemning it.<br />
<br />
The boy was an international student from Qatar. He was studying at the EF International Language School. International students plays vital role in every country because they are likely to settle in the host country whereas such incidents like this will encourage the students to pursue their careers in other countries like new Zealand, Australia and Canada. In the end its us who is losing the benefit.<br />
<br />
If they pursue their careers in United Kingdom they will be playing major role in developing our country, we will have plenty of Doctors, Engineers, Scholars, Teachers, and Nurses Etc in our country we will be number one. Our economy will be rising and we will have less crimes.. What image are we creating by telling the foreign students as well investors not to invest in our country as your children are not safe here?<br />
<br />
The father of young lad said Mohammed was young student who was loved by his family, friends and teachers. He was a charming, lovely boy and there is nothing that can replace our loss. Justice has to be done in this investigation. All of those involved in committing this crime, on a young, innocent 16- year old boy should be punished.<br />
<br />
Witnesses said that the lad was with a group of friends when they were approached by white youths who were hanging around outside the restaurant. And a most shocking thing is that the owner of the restaurant told couple of police officers before the incident to watch a group of white youths who are hanging around the restaurant. He said I asked them to keep an eye on the boys, and they said they would-then left, Less than an hour later, Mohammed had been beaten to death. There are no words that can describe the horror of what happened. The attack seemed unprovoked and without reason.<br />
<br />
Now we must look at the number of foreign students who visit Hasting to study language, it is between 30,000 and 50,000. Now you decide we are already facing credit crunch what effect will this incident bring to our Country if in 2009 parents dont send their children to Hasting because of security problems.<br />
<br />
I think we should condemn such shameful incidents and always shame racism not matter in which form it exists in any country.<br />

This racial  offensive behavior is kind of sickness even  lead to motivate countries like Germany to attack other nation by Hitler the Nazi and even  England  one of the victim of Nazi hate and war to other nation the crime committed against the handsome Qatari young student is horrible and shame to kill innocent student this crime committed against Hastings because as you know many millions of pounds came to your town and your reputation will  be  known as  the town of racial crime and hatred  and this reputation against the developing plans to increase the  number of the student  and  the peoples of Hastings  as the nice   families who host the student and  the language school will lose an income  and some of them depend upon the foreign student</div></div><hr />

First I send my thanks from the land of Jesus and Moses and Mohammed and as you know Christianity and Jewish and Islam came 3 of them from the middle east and you can say Jesus is a middle eastern and the holy land also in the middle east as the church of nativity in the middle east my respect to the peoples of Hastings<br />
Who attend 2 minute silence in the memory of Mohammed Al Majed also the media who cover the news about the hateful crime I pray May his Soul rest in peace and God bless all<br />
This racial offensive behavior is kind of sickness even this violent is dangerous to the local community we learned this racial hate motivated countries like Germany to attack other nation as Hitler the Nazi did and attacked England as one of his victims I hope as the <br />

Foreign students visiting Hastings are given a DVD advising them how to act to best avoid attack.<br />
The short films form part of a package given out to visiting youngsters by The Safer Hastings Partnership (SHP) - a collective formed by bodies such as Hastings Borough Council and the local police force.<br />
<br />
It offers practical advise to students about how to keep themselves safe and helps make them aware of laws and customs in the UK.<br />
<br />
It is one of a number of schemes operated in Hastings and St Leonards which has seen a gradual drop in the number of attacks on language students. The number of crimes committed against visiting students is now less than one per 1,000 students.<br />
<br />
In fact, the SHP has been congratulated on its work as recently as last April when the town was named one of the best destinations for foreign students by the Italian Association of Language Consultants and Agents (IALCA).<br />
<br />
David Furness, community safety manager with the SHP, was even invited to Naples and much of the SHP's work in student safety has been copied across the UK.<br />
<br />
Mr Furness said: &quot;The death of Mohammed al-Majed is extremely tragic.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sure it is little consolation to Mohammed's family that this incident is unprecedented in Hastings, but as we have said, this will strengthen our resolve to to continue to do all we can to work together to make Hastings a safe place to live, work and visit.&quot;<br />

4th Pa. teen charged in killing of immigrant Sat Sep 6, <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Authorities in Pennsylvania say a fourth teenager has been charged in the fatal beating of a Mexican immigrant.<br />
<br />
Schuylkill County prosecutors charged the teen in juvenile court Friday with aggravated assault, ethnic intimidation and other offenses. His name and age are not being released.<br />
<br />
Three others are charged as adults in the July attack in the town of Shenandoah on 25-year-old factory worker Luis Ramirez.<br />
<br />
Homicide charges are filed against 16-year-old Brandon Piekarsky and 17-year-old Colin Walsh. Eighteen-year-old Derrick Donchak faces aggravated assault and other charges.<br />
<br />
A local school district has agreed to provide Piekarsky and Walsh with 12 hours of in-home education per week while the case against them is pending.<br />

He wants to stop crime  <br />

The New Paper  <br />
        <br />
  <br />
 <br />
ANOTHER activist from Singapore is staging an anti-crime protest in New Zealand.<br />
<br />
Mr Peter Low said the government there is 'not listening to the cries of the people'. So yesterday, the immigrant from Singapore, who is a staunch anti-crime campaigner, took to the streets.<br />
<br />
Last month, Mr Low led a 15,000-strong protest calling for tougher sentences and laws following a series of high-profile murders of Asians in Auckland.<br />
<br />
As reported in The New Paper, he had then threatened to call for the triads to protect the community if the government failed to act.<br />
<br />
This went largely ignored. He said he had still not heard from anyone in the government after the march.<br />
<br />
'The government is not listening, and many in the Asian community are still angry and frustrated with the laws in New Zealand,' Mr Low claimed.<br />
<br />
Last month, a 5-year-old Chinese girl was abducted while she was playing outside her home. The march was organised in response to her kidnapping.<br />
<br />
But unlike the first protest, only a small crowd of 50 people turned up for the demonstration. in North Shore, Auckland<br />
<br />
But, Mr Low said: 'I don't think the number of people is important, but the message that demonstrations like these carry.<br />
<br />
'This time, it is not just Asians who are protesting, but people of all races - Maori and Europeans - who are fed up with weak laws.'<br />
<br />
Mr Low emigrated in 1987 to New Zealand , where he now runs a grocery import and wholesale business, and a lion dance group. He also teaches martial arts.<br />
<br />
Protest organiser Max Whitehead said that stronger laws would help to lower crime rate in New Zealand.<br />
<br />
'Stronger laws are the answer to lowering crime, and there are plenty of examples to show,' he said.<br />
<br />
'Just look at Singapore - why is it the level of violent crimes there is nowhere even close to what we are experiencing in New Zealand?'<br />
<br />
Mr Whitehead, who has a daughter, 8, asked: 'What kind of society are we living in when our kids can't even play safely outside our own homes?' he asked.<br />
<br />
However, North Shore police area commander Les Paterson said he was not surprised at the low turnout because of the choice of venue for the demonstration.<br />
<br />
'North Shore City has the lowest crime rate per capita, not just in Auckland, but the whole of New Zealand,' he said.<br />
<br />
Mr Low, who is heads the Asian Anti-crime Group, said he was planning a much bigger anti-crime protest next month in Auckland's central business district, ahead of the country's general election.<br />

Hundreds of residents attended the event organised on the Corniche in remembrance of the slain Qatari youth and as a stand against racism and violence. (SHAIVAL DALAL) <br />
Residents wear yellow in tribute to slain Qatari student <br />
<br />
DOHA  People from different communities yesterday assembled on the Corniche, near Doha Sheraton, to take a stand against racism and also to show their sympathy for the family of Qatari student Mohammed Al Majed who was murdered in Hastings, UK recently. <br />
<br />
The silent stand event was co-ordinated jointly by different groups like qatarliving, iloveqatar.net (ILQ) and expatwomanqatar.com. <br />
<br />
The gathering saw approximately a hundred people participating in the stand. Those participating in the event wore yellow cloths to distinguish themselves from the rest of the crowd. Due to Ramadan the event was held between 4:45pm to 5:00pm.  <br />
 <br />
<br />
The family members of Mohammed Al Majed also attended the silent stand. &quot;It's a tragedy to lose our loved one. We are out here to support the groups who organised the event,&quot; said Rana Salatt, the aunt of Mohammed Al Majed. <br />
<br />
The people who were present at the event expressed their condolences. &quot;We are planning to use this opportunity to show our sympathy for the family of Mohamed and also make a stand against this kind of meaningless violence. Hopefully, the UK government and others around the world will take note and give this kind of behaviour zero tolerance,&quot; said Gwen Newnham. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have gathered to pay my respects to the family of Mohammed Al Majed,&quot; said Andrew Sandilands, a construction manager at El Seif. <br />
<br />
&quot;The event was a great success as there were a lot of Qataris besides other residents,&quot; said Khalifa Haroun of iloveqatar.net. <br />
<br />
&quot;In our culture, we believe that for every death, there is a reason as it is in God's hands. I'm sure that young Mohammed's death will open a lot of peoples' eyes in the world and it would not have been in vain.&quot; <br />
<br />
Families also took part in the event. &quot;The incident was pretty distressing. Racism affects us all. We are here to say no to it. This sort of behaviour should not be tolerated in a civil society,&quot; said John Gregg from Qatar Foundation. John and his family took part in this event and paid their last respects to Mohammed Al Majed. <br />
<br />
&quot;We are gathered here to ensure that such incidents are not repeated in the future,&quot; said Shikharvaieye of Darwish Travels, who was accompanied by his wife. <br />

 <br />
 <br />
John Hawkins... UK-Qatar ties growing <br />
By Bonnie James<br />
Britain would like to contemplate more investment in Qatars oil and gas and financial sectors, apart from collaborative ventures in education, the new British Ambassador to Qatar, John Hawkins, said yesterday.<br />
The envoy, who completes a month in office today, said that he was looking forward to working with HH the Emirs government to achieve the shared goals of increasing bilateral trade and investment, building peace and security in the region, and strengthening educational links.<br />
Describing Britain and Qatar as old friends sharing a very close and long relationship that is changing into a modern one of partnership, Hawkins observed that he is particularly pleased by how fast the mutual links are growing, across almost all sectors.<br />
In the first half of 2008 we exported goods of £352mn to Qatar, an increase of 10% on the same period last year, the ambassador revealed while observing that the same growth is seen in the British community in Qatar, which is now over 10,000, compared with around 9,000 this time last year.<br />
Hawkins said Britain was honoured that so many Qataris sought the UK as their favourite destination for business, holidays and study. This summer we issued just under 12,000 visas to the UK, a 15% increase on 2007, he said.<br />
More than 500 students from Qatar are pursuing undergraduate courses in the UK whereas about 170 are doing post-graduate programmes.<br />
Referring to the recent tragic death of Qatari student Mohamed al-Majed at Hastings in the UK, the ambassador described it as appalling news.<br />
I dont believe it represents our country of 60mn people. There is a determination on the part of the authorities in Hastings to do what is needed. There is a very clear awareness among the British government that we have some problem in some cities during Friday and Saturday, he said referring to the situation that led to al-Majeds death.<br />
Hawkins recalled that the embassy has been in close touch with the al-Majed family and facilitated their visit to Hastings for a memorial service last week and meetings with local authorities.<br />
We are acting as a bridge between the family and the British government and ready to do all that is needed to support them, he said while pointing that there has been very strong feelings of revulsion about the incident among the people of Hastings and the rest of the UK.<br />
The envoy was of the view that when two countries have so many links at so many levels, unfortunately they have to accept that occasionally there will be bad news from time to time as well as good news.<br />
Asked about the present status of investigation into the incident, Hawkins said that he could not comment any further than that the Sussex Police are giving the case top priority.<br />
The ambassador maintained that a racially motivated assault is considered more serious than a normal assault and an attack against a visitor more outrageous than against a British national.<br />
The reaction of people in the UK, as here in Qatar, has been one of horror. We pride ourselves on the fact that for the vast majority of our visitors, Britain is a safe and welcoming place, he added.<br />

<br />
 <br />
02 September 2008 <br />
By Sandra Daniels <br />
<br />
POLICE dealt with a fracas on Friday night outside the kebab shop where exactly a week earlier a fight resulted in the death of foreign student Mohammed Al-Majed.<br />
<br />
Four people are to appear in court in connection with the latest incident, one charged with a racially motivated public order offence.<br />
<br />
Officers had been in the area of the Kebab Hut and Pizza Shop at the junction of Robertson Street until after midnight as part of an anniversary operation to trace more witnesses to the assault on Mohammed.<br />
<br />
About an hour after that finished a disturbance broke out when two young women tried to enter the kebab shop, which runs a night-time club.<br />
<br />
Inspector Martin Mann told the Observer: &quot;At about 1.50am there was an incident in the kebab shop during which the doors were damaged, racist comments were allegedly made, and police officers were obstructed and assaulted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two local females, aged 17 and 20, were arrested and two local males, aged 22 and 34, who intervened were also arrested.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were interviewed the following morning in relation to the incident and between them they have been charged with a total of eight offences, one of which is a racially motivated public order offence.<br />
<br />
&quot;The other charges include criminal damage, assaulting police, obstructing police and resisting arrest.&quot;<br />
<br />
The four will appear at Hastings Magistrates Court on Wednesday September 10.<br />

Attack on Lawrence memorial 'was racist'<br />
By Jerome Taylor<br />
Friday, 15 February 2008 <br />
<br />
<br />
Vandals have attacked a centre for inner-city children that was built to commemorate the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence, causing thousands of pounds worth of damage only a week after it was opened to the public.<br />
<br />
<br />
Police said they were treating the attack on the Stephen Lawrence Centre in Deptford, south-east London, as a racially motivated incident and that the hate crime unit at Lewisham CID were investigating. <br />
<br />
The attackers are believed to have struck in the early hours of yesterday, causing more than £100,000 worth of damage. Eight reinforced windows designed by the Turner Prize-winning artist Chris Ofili, and dedicated to Stephen's mother Doreen, were destroyed during an attack which sources said was &quot;sustained and planned&quot;.<br />
<br />
The attack on the £10m centre, designed by the award-winning architect David Adjaye, immediately drew condemnation from anti-racism campaigners and politicians.<br />
<br />
The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, said he was &quot;disgusted&quot; by the attack on the centre. &quot;This latest outrageous act of racism follows several others over the past few months on the centre,&quot; he said. &quot;It also comes on the anniversary of the inquest that confirmed Stephen's death to be an unprovoked racist murder and will be even more distressing for his mother, who has fought to establish this cultural landmark for the whole community.&quot;<br />
<br />
The centre was built to inspire young people of all races from deprived backgrounds to pursue careers in design and architecture, the career path that Stephen had hoped to follow. The 18-year-old student was stabbed to death by a racist gang after being attacked as he waited at a bus stop in Eltham 15 years ago. His killers have never been brought to justice and some of those suspected of carrying out the murder still live in the area. <br />
<br />
The inquiry into how the authorities handled the murder investigation accused the Metropolitan Police of &quot;institutional racism&quot; and lead to a major overhaul of how racist crimes were dealt with by police forces. <br />
<br />
Dr Richard Stone, an adviser to the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry said yesterday: &quot;This seems to have been a premeditated attack aimed at causing distress to the Lawrence family because they are black.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a sad day for people committed to equality of human beings and is a reminder of the injustice faced by the Lawrences.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yesterday's attack is the fourth time that the centre has been targeted by vandals in the past year. <br />

The previous &quot;answers&quot; show how the problems get mixed up.<br />
<br />
We're not talking about asylum seekers here. In Hastings foreign STUDENTS get routinely beaten up and it's been the case for years. <br />
It happens to French, German, Arab-looking people. <br />
<br />
Hastings has pockets of xenophobia that are absolutely unacceptable for any town, especially one that size. Are you guys aware of how bad it looks to the rest of, nevermind the country, but Europe?<br />
<br />
It's disheartening to read interviews about ongoing episode of violence against those wealthy students who bring money into the local economy...and have the local chavs reply that they don't want asylum seekers. Can someone explain what the connection is???? Hello???<br />
<br />
There's an article on the subject that I find very interesting on a Birmingham-based blog called Hagley Road to Ladywood:<br />

East Sussex native Emma Munn on the final testament to the town's soaring race hate crisis. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thousands of language students come to Hastings and other coastal town across southern England every year, providing a boost to the economy and filling the streets with excited teenagers from all over the world. Mohammed Al Majed was one of them.<br />
<br />
The wealthy 16 year old had come from Qatar to improve his English over the summer and was a week away from being reunited with his parents when, for no apparent reason other than being Arab, was set upon by a group of youths outside a seafront Kebab house.<br />
He was beaten, kicked, had bottles thrown at him together with jeering insults of 'Bin Laden'. These bold citizens also took turns at stamping on his head until, racked by severe injuries, he died in the street.<br />
<br />
Once a fashionable resort during the Victorian era frequented by poets, artists and writers, Hastings popularity has gone into sharp decline over the past 30 years. During the 40s and 50s it was a haven for Londoners wanting a cheap seaside break, but with the introduction of package holidays lost its quaint appeal, resulting in massive financial losses and unemployment.<br />
Walking though this town (where I spent most of my teenage life) the initial reaction is one of uneasiness and slight sadness. The seafront is a mess of large, once grand and expensive townhouses now converted into squalid flats or boarded up, paint peeling and gardens overgrown. The promenade is full of hooded youths clutching cans of Skol and, as a final blow to the ambience of the seafront, the pier was closed two years ago and now stands rotting. The whole image is one of despair and neglect.<br />
<br />
Foreign students here are treated with contempt. This year, between April and August alone, there were 100 reported assaults on language students. Not surprising when you consider that in this small town there are 37.1 violent crimes for every 1000 people against a national average of 16, and drug offences rose sharply by 30% in 2007. This is a town of just over 80,000 people. It doesn't take a genius to work out that Hastings has some problems.<br />
<br />
The usual concurrence between locals regarding those-who-are-not-English is one of 'Get rid of them, there's too many and they're taking over' quickly followed by the typical '...Don't get me wrong though, I'm not racist or anyfink'. Coupled and finished off with the extreme, laughable ignorance of 'I'm sick of them, these people are a drain on the economy. They come here saying they are in danger then they don't leave. They take our jobs and money'.<br />
Poetry in motion by a populace who can't even separate asylum seekers and immigrants from kids spending 5 weeks in their town and spending a fortune for the privilege of doing so. Work out for yourselves who is more of a drain on society.<br />
<br />
Flicking through an EF brochure at work, I noticed that Hastings was one of three towns offered to students over the summer to study at. The other two, Oxford and Cambridge, were general de************************ions of the town, brief history and other basic information. Hastings however was more like a competition for how many times you can fit the words safe and safety into one paragraph; 'A safe environment for students, a safe town center, comfort and safety in a great town to learn in, safe, safe, safe' as if the town was so desperate to portray itself as something it isn't. Hastings is a town so safe that students who go out drinking in the town leave the bars early to avoid the locals, and sometimes leave the town altogether for evenings out, preferring the liberal atmosphere of Brighton.<br />
<br />
Rife unemployment, poor education, the small-town mentality of people who are bringing up their kids with the racial views of the worst League of Gentlemen standard (all non-whites and non-English don't work and take benefits that I could have) and bad diets of crap, misinformed newspapers and magazines are conducive to breeding new generations of ignorant and sometimes violent individuals without basic principles. Hastings in the lead up to the next decade will be the flagbearer of all these things.<br />
<br />
The harsh fact is that if you are a foreign student wanting to improve your English abroad this year, the 'safest' thing you can do in the future is avoid Hastings at all costs.<br />

But it seems to me that almost the entire local population of Hastings are on benefits. and they spend their giro on cheap booze to be guzzled by the rusty shut-down pier. <br />
<br />
No question though. Those foreign students should be beaten up. You know why? For their stupidity in picking the arsehole of England, such a dodgy, supercrap town as their FOREIGN HOLIDAY destination!<br />
<br />
How dumb can you be??????<br />

Qatari student, 16, dies after 'race' attack<br />
<br />
Helen Pidd The Guardian, Tuesday August 26 2008 <br />
<br />
<br />
 16-year-old Middle Eastern language school student has died after being beaten up in what police believe was a racially motivated attack.<br />
<br />
Mohammed al-Majed, who was from the Gulf state of Qatar, died in hospital on Sunday night from severe head injuries two days after he and his friends were set upon outside a kebab shop in Hastings, East Sussex. Police are treating his death as murder.<br />
<br />
Majed, described by friends as &quot;like a brother to everyone&quot;, had spent five weeks in Hastings studying English at the EF International Language School. He had been due to return home next week.<br />
<br />
He and his friends were set upon as they left a social club for foreign students shortly before midnight on Friday. They were beaten, kicked and pelted with glass bottles by a group of youths, who stamped repeatedly on Majed's head before leaving him for dead. <br />
<br />
Majed's room-mate, Majd Al Ghannamah, 19, who suffered a black eye, said the assailants chanted racist abuse during the attack. &quot;They called me Saddam Hussain and Osama Bin Laden. We just wanted to get away, get home, but they attacked and we couldn't get away,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Another student suffered a head injury needing six stitches. &quot;I blame myself for not saving Mohammed, but where I come from, we are not used to this kind of thing happening. At home, we never need to defend ourselves like that,&quot; said the boy, who did not want to be named.<br />
<br />
A witness said the police had been warned earlier that evening about trouble brewing between locals and the foreigners. But they went away, and Majed was attacked an hour later. Sussex police said yesterday they had no record of the warning, but admitted officers may well have been in the area before the attack.<br />
<br />
Majed had been socialising at a club at the USA Fried Chicken and Kebab house, which has a large area with pool tables at the back used as a hangout by students who come to study English each summer.<br />
<br />
The owner, Remzi Tanriverdi, 43, said trouble started after some local youths started drinking alcohol outside the shop. Tanriverdi, a Kurd who moved to Hastings five years ago, asked them to leave, but they refused and verbally abused him. <br />
<br />
He said: &quot;After I asked them to leave, I noticed a police car pull up outside. I asked them to keep an eye on the boys, and they said they would - then left. Less than an hour later, Mohammed - who was like a brother to everyone here - had been beaten. The attack was completely unprovoked and without reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tanriverdi said he had complained to the police &quot;more than 20 times&quot; about problems with local youths since he bought the kebab shop in 2005.<br />
<br />
He added: &quot;What parent will want to send their children here when they know things like this are happening?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yesterday another of Majed's room-mates, 17-year-old Abdul Aziz, said: &quot;We are all deeply shocked at what's happened. Mohammed was everyone's friend. We cannot believe something like this could happen. We will never come back here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Three males, aged 17, 18 and 20, have been arrested and released on police bail pending further inquiries.<br />
<br />
Detective Chief Inspector Graham Pratt, who is leading the investigation, appealed for witnesses. &quot;The young man was a visitor to Hastings and his death is tragic. Our thoughts are with his family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sussex police said it had increased patrols in the area to reassure people and would continue to work with language schools to address any issues.<br />
<br />
It is estimated that about 30,000 to 50,000 foreign students come to Hastings and nearby Rother each summer.<br />

BizarreBroken Britain's Battle of HatingsFrom ANILA BAIG<br />
in Hastings <br />
<br />
Published: 28 Aug 2008<br />
<br />
 <br />
FAMED for 1066, Hastings is now gaining notoriety as a racial battleground following the violent death of a young Arab student. <br />
We sent a Sun reporter to the East Sussex town to talk to local and foreign residents about the mounting tensions. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
DEPORT them! Deport the bloody lot of them! Tony is so angry his shirt buttons pop open as he races out of a games arcade into the street to join in our conversation. <br />
<br />
It is 10pm and Im in Hastings, where last week 16-year-old Mohammed Al Majed was allegedly kicked to death. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Kicked to death ... <br />
Sun's report on killing<br />
<br />
It is claimed a mob of hoodies took turns stamping on his head. <br />
<br />
Mohammed, from Qatar, died two days later. <br />
<br />
Three men aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested and freed on bail. <br />
<br />
And the apparent motive for the attack? Mohammeds skin colour.<br />
<br />
Listening to Tonys rantings about immigrants, Im wondering if this town should be renamed Hatings. <br />
<br />
Im sick of em, he says. These people are a drain on the economy. They come here saying they are in danger, then they wont leave. They take our jobs, they take our money. <br />
<br />
He pauses, then adds: Dont get me wrong, Im not a racist. <br />
<br />
What about the recent killing, I ask. Nah, didnt hear about that, but these asylum seekers come here . . .  <br />
<br />
I explain that Mohammed wasnt an asylum seeker and that his family paid a lot of money for him to study English. <br />
<br />
This momentarily softens Tony, who says: I dont have a problem with students. They contribute to the economy. Its the leeches I have a problem with. <br />
<br />
<br />
Contributing is an understatement. The economy of this once popular seaside resort is now propped up by the 50,000 students who flock here each year for language courses. <br />
<br />
Not everyone sees it like that. One of Tonys friends, who refuses to give her name, says she objects to all foreigner visitors. <br />
<br />
There are too many of them. They have taken over, thats the truth. These . . . students, she spits out the word, they are everywhere. You talk about fear, but Im scared to go out at night because of THEM. <br />
<br />
This isnt our country any more. <br />
<br />
She is unmoved by Mohammeds death. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Local ... Jon<br />
<br />
Ive not heard about that but even if that has happened, why do they come here then if they feel their lives are in danger? <br />
<br />
Her friend, Jon Collyer 21, adds: Not being racist, but you do feel over-run. Sometimes, because they dont know the rules, they walk in the middle of the road and you see people trying to knock them down. <br />
<br />
He sounds serious but then grins. I dont know whether he is joking. <br />
<br />
His mate is back on the topic of asylum seekers. <br />
<br />
She tells me: They get houses and mobile phones. They get BMWs, you know. Ive lived here all my life, I cant even afford a car. <br />
<br />
I explain that asylum seekers dont get BMWs and, in fact, many can barely afford to eat. <br />
<br />
Well, maybe not BMWs, she concedes, but they get loads of free stuff. The Government gives them everything, welcomes them with open arms and were bottom of the pile. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tension ... Hastings<br />
<br />
<br />
I decide it is time to head off to meet some Arab students and ask whether they have been welcomed to Hastings. <br />
<br />
A 23-year-old lad, who gives only his initials, SA, tells me: I was sitting on the beach and some boys started throwing stones at me. I was shocked. I wasnt doing anything. <br />
<br />
Trouble <br />
I wanted my three brothers to come here but I have now told them not to. My course is ending and I leave next week. I wont be back. <br />
<br />
People here look at you with hatred  you can see in their eyes they think we shouldnt be there. <br />
<br />
Sometimes they walk alongside you trying to provoke you. They make fun of the way we talk. Only a minority are friendly. <br />
<br />
Mohammed was attacked outside a kebab shop. Now it is business as usual. But there are signs of the tragedy inside. <br />
<br />
Flowers cover a table next to a book of condolence. <br />
<br />
I flick through and see messages from both students and locals. A circle of students are standing nearby. I ask if they knew Mohammed. <br />
<br />
One, Abdulaziz Al-Meshri, says: I knew him. All our parents are so worried. They keep telling us, not to go out alone. Keep safe. As soon as our courses finished, we are out of here, transferring to other cities or leaving the UK altogether. <br />
<br />
Ive been here ten months. At first I was picked on a lot because I couldnt speak the language, people making fun. As I learned English, I felt more accepted. <br />
<br />
Even so, the 19-year-old admits: I wont go in any pubs or clubs in Hastings. We go to Brighton. There is not the same problem there. <br />
<br />
Another lad says: When foreigners come to our country, we treat them with respect and kindness as a guest. We dont feel that here. <br />
<br />
A girl called Hala, 22, tells me: The Arab students have designer clothes and mobiles. <br />
<br />
Some locals dont have much money and are jealous. They see these boys with cash and they dont like it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Taking in the towns formerly grand buildings, many of them now divided into grotty flats or boarded up, it seems she may have a point. <br />
<br />
It is a balmy August evening yet the streets are almost deserted. <br />
<br />
Anti-drugs posters plastered around indicate another of the towns problems. <br />
<br />
In a fish and chip shop the man serving stares at me so much that I cant help blurting out: What? <br />
<br />
He replies: You look . . . hungry. <br />
<br />
I ask him about the town and he says: There can be a lot of trouble at the weekends, people have no money so they might take your purse. There is a lot of drugs. Dont go out on the pier alone. <br />
<br />
Naturally, many locals wont hear a bad word said about their town. <br />
<br />
The taxi driver who takes me to the station says: I been here 15 years and I love it. Didnt you like it? <br />
<br />
Of course, I reply vaguely, before heading for my train home. <br />

ON October 14, 1066, French invader William the Conqueror defeated King Harold II at the Battle of Hastings. <br />
<br />
By the 1800s, the former fishing village had become a fashionable seaside resort. <br />
<br />
However, in recent years its popularity has declined. <br />
<br />
Drugs offences rose by 39 per cent last year, to 634 cases. <br />
<br />
There were 37.1 violent crimes for every 1,000 people. <br />
<br />
The national average is 16.7. <br />
<br />
There have been 98 crimes against language school students in the past three years, including 41 assaults. <br />
<br />
The population is now 86,200. Unemployment is 3.3 per cent. <br />
