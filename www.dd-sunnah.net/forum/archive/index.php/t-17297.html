<br />
Furthermore, what diffrence does it make whether or not you're a Muslim? hmm<br />
<br />
We're here to discuss differences between Muslims &amp; Shi'ites. If your fellow is a Shi'ite, by all means have him stop by here to check it out. I personally haven't seen any rude comments. Forget that, I haven't seen a Shi'ite writing here in order to be rude to, now have yuh</div></div><hr />

i think that must be a very bad way to control a site about relegion system and i would see the conversation but i will be silent i don`t wanna talk can i ?<br />
<br />
Lets see now....<br />
1- You are not Muslim.<br />
2- A Friend told you about this site being &quot;so rude&quot; to users, insulting him even when hes &quot;quiet&quot; ( I dont know how one can be seen on a board when quiet in the first place )<br />
3- Based on the above, you get to your conclusion.<br />
Does anyone else see the same pattern on how shias get to their conclusions? This post has a shia smell to it.<br />
Reasons are....<br />
1- You know Arabic, and you Arabic is better than your English, as is apperant from how you wrote the topic and your post.<br />
2- You could have simply read the boards and pointed out something specific so that your objection would be clear.<br />
3- You say you are not Muslim yet seem to be so concerned, yet that concern wasnt enough for you to browse the site yourself? hmmm...<br />
4- You managed to reach this English board without reading the posts which shows that you ignored them, even though you were so concerned, and base your conclusion on what your friend told you instead of reading yourself.<br />
5- You did not get into any details or provide specific evidence. Our Quran tells us &quot;Oh ye who believe, if a fasiq brings you news, verify it&quot;<br />
Since you say you are not Muslim, you must fall into one of the following categories :<br />
1- you are an Arabic speaking Christian<br />
2- You are an Arabic speaking Athiest.<br />
3- You are an Arabic speaking Shia.<br />
4- You are an Arabic speaking Agnostic.<br />
5- You are an Arabic speaking Jew.<br />
6- You are an Arabic speaking Magian.<br />
Providing what I have noticed that I mentioned above... I reach the following conclusions...<br />
1- You are a shia.<br />
2-You slandered without verifying. ( As usual )<br />
3- You lied ( as usual )<br />
4- You chose this way as if it would effect the credability of this board, while it wouldnt effect anyones credability but yours, simply because you couldnt get into any details in replying to the posts about shia beliefs.<br />
<br />
Is it only me who sees this pattern? Its really interesting when one examines the shia beliefs and knows their behaviors and ways of thinking.<br />
Thank you very much for the post, as when those with weak positions, try to find arguements, it only makes their positions weaker naturally, and proves what we say about shias about never being straight forward.<br />
<br />
Regardless of what you are, if you have anything to prove any belief which we do not have, and wish to discuss it in a calm scientific polite manner, I do not think the moderator would object, rather he would encourage that, I have talked enough to him to be able to expect his encouragement, I say this because we feel that our poistion is very strong, and any discussion would display that. We have nothing to hide. ( unlike &quot;some&quot; people )<br />
<br />
In the end, if you have anything to offer, we would be more than willing to discuss it with you, but plain slander, is the tool of the weak, as Socrates  said 'When the debate is lost, slander becomes the tool of the loser.&quot; <br />
<br />
I advise you to fear Allah, and keep sincerity in your heart, and remember that the point of the discussions on these boards, is education, not just to prove ones self. In the heat of debates however, many forget what they are here for, so they just want to &quot;win&quot; forgetting that whats being discussed is a matter of heaven and hell and end up letting their anger in the heated debates, direct them instead of their minds.<br />
<br />
So when you want to think, dont be thinking &quot;I will look for evidences that prove the religion I was raised in&quot; rather you should think &quot;I will find out what the evidences prove, and make it my religion&quot; Only then will any given religion will have a very solid base.<br />
<br />
I hope that we get good discussions instead of pure slander, from either you or your spooky invisible anonymous &quot;friend&quot;.</div></div><hr />
