Heres an email that I have recieved from a particpant in a yahoo group, after reading a post about shias that contained a translation of one of the famous videos. Hope it motivates the owners of the site to start working on the English section knowing how many people it would benefit. Wallahi whoever reads this  and has some Eman in his heart cannot but feel the need for this section and would work hard on it. I would do one on my own on a seperate site but due to certain reasons, I frankly cant, and you definatly can, rather it is a responsibilty of yours and mine as Muslims.<br />
<br />
Salaam Alkiakum,<br />
<br />
May Allah reward you for the work you are doing. I<br />
know you would like to receive email from those those<br />
who could help you with this great job you are doing.<br />
I am sorry I can't help you, my Arabic is not so good.<br />
<br />
I am writing this email just to let you know how<br />
important this work you are doing is. I live in London<br />
and I have met many many Muslims. Did you know those<br />
who go out from Islam to Christianity or no religion<br />
mostly are Shia Muslims? During my university study I<br />
met a good friend. She confided to me that her husband<br />
who is a PHD in a science subject  no longer believed<br />
in Islam. I wanted to argue with her it is not Islam<br />
it is Shia sector that lied about Islam. She even<br />
commented how easy is your Sunni! With my little<br />
knowledge I kept quiet. <br />
<br />
The second time I was quiet  when  a shop owner from<br />
Shai told me he was no longer a Muslim because of<br />
complications. I have met a nurse also from Shia many<br />
many  of them brother.<br />
<br />
The Muslim scholars have put alot of effort on<br />
converting Christians but forgot their fellow Muslims<br />
brothers and sisters. I congratulate you with this<br />
work you have been doing and i hope you find more<br />
people to help you.<br />
<br />
From your sister,<br />
uma Zakira<br />
<br />
I wonder how long it will take for the brothers to know the importance of this and get some work on the English site done!<br />
Assalamu Alaikom</div></div><hr />

<br />
You cannot imagine how large is the Rafidite effort in trying to spread their religion. They have complete encyclopedias of Shiasm in English, rebuttals to Sunni dialogues, they send Rafiditie booklets with flashy &quot;Islamic&quot; titles in almost any language you can think of to any place in the world for free, they fund a lot of humanitarian aid + schools in underdevloped countries, they give scholarships to Qum, they have didicated radio channels in different languages to spread their religion, they give a lot of aid to potential &quot;converts&quot;, they fund a lot of forums , gatherings under the banner of Islam to spread their religion etc etc etc<br />
<br />
<br />
And we cannot get a simple thing as an English discussion forum done properly!!<br />
<br />
If this is not going to motivate the moderators I don't know what will!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
May Allah help brother Hajjaj and all the moderators in finding a solution to this problem. Brother Straighpath has offered his help, I am afraid I can't offer much when it comes to technical knowledge about setting up a homepage never mind a discussion board, besides that I am willing to help Insha' allah.<br />
<br />
Your brother Mohammed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StraightPath</div><div class="date">30-12-03, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jazak Allah Khair bro Al a'asha ( wow I think I am the first to transliterate that ) for your possitive response.<br />
<br />
To be honest, one of the most important issues in this is Arabic material getting translated. You have posted things that I have never seen on the net before and never expected to see. Please do not underestimate their importance and try to get more material translated ( whoever translates what you post ).<br />
<br />
Then insha'Allah, if the brothers here don't do much, i'll figure out a way to launch another website despite some technical/hosting problems.<br />
<br />
In addition to that, there was a post by brother Al Shadhili about books that shias use against the sunnah, yet the **************************** is almost never authentic, or they would say this book by so and so said this and that while the name is actually a name of a Shia scholar who had the same name of a Sunni one causing confusion to those who do not have much knowledge. So you could translate some important posts. I will do my best in doing so also.<br />
<br />
Once theres collected material, insha'Allah we can figure out solutions for hosting and other technical issues, but lets not give up just yet on the brothers here and try to get this messege through in the Arabic section also, and in public so that it may be read by decision-makers.<br />
<br />
Jazak Allah khair for your support and encouragement.<br />
<br />
Assalamu Alaikom</div></div><hr />

 Actually, the English section should get more care from all of us... especially after the last Iraqi war which has exported the SHIA term to the world.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, most of the non-Arab people, mainly westerns, feel pity toward those SHIA; we need to expose the real pungent of that term to them, so they stop attaching the terrorism to Sunnah by letting them know it from the other face (SHIA) ñ the antithesis makes the thesis clearer.<br />
<br />
From this point Iíll try to translate and convert, what I feel is, the important subjects from the Arabic section into English.<br />
<br />

Hope bro Al Hajjaj also helps us using his position to help  push this board forward.</div></div><hr />
