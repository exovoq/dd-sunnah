We know the year that the New Testament depicts that Jesus began his ministry since Luke specifies the year Jesus went to the river Jordan to be baptized by John the Baptist. <br />
<br />
&quot;In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberias Caesar&quot; (Luke 3:1). <br />
<br />
Luke again give us the age of Jesus when he first began his ministry. <br />
<br />
Luke 3:23 Jesus, now about 30 years old travels from his home-town of Nazareth in Galilee <br />
<br />
If one reads the Gospels then he is struck by the purely legendary accounts of Jesus' nativity and childhood. It is only after this that we come to the public period of his life. It must be remembered that the sayings and deeds attributed to Jesus existed only in an oral form for at least four decades or longer after his death before they were put into writing in the now missing Q and the gospel of Mark. One should expect that these oral traditions to have passed through many different persons before reaching their written form. We find the first quote of one of the Synoptic Gospels no earlier than 180 A.D. with Irenaeus. As it that is not problematic enough, there was no guarantee whatsoever that the early compilers of Jesus' words and deeds knew how to differentiate the authentic from the fictitious accounts. That becomes our task as inheritors of the Roman New Testament. <br />
<br />
Modern scholars teach us that the Gospel of Mark is the earliest of the four gospels and was definitely composed from traditional (not direct eye-witness) sources which already contained mistakes regarding the culture and geography of Palestine. <br />
<br />
Answer for yourself: What should we learn from the Gospel of Mark containing such inaccuracies? Basically we be very careful in reading Mark and be wary that we do not accept as historical what is mythical. In fact, uncertainties abound regarding the events described by the gospels regarding Jesusí period of ministry. <br />
<br />
An example of this uncertainty is in the actual duration of the ministry of Jesus. While it is not stated explicitly in any of the four gospels, we can gather allusions to the actual length of time Jesus went about preaching by looking for internal clues within these documents. <br />
<br />
Answer for yourself: Are you aware that the Synoptic Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke disagree as to the length of time of Jesus ministry when compared to the Gospel of John?<br />
<br />
A reading of the synoptics reveals to the astute reader ONLY ONE celebration of the Passover and that at no point in the earlier narratives was it hinted that even a year had gone by. This shows us that Jesus career lasted, at the utmost, a single year. <br />
<br />
In John's gospel however, we find that three Passover festivals were mentioned to have occurred during the ministry of Jesus:<br />
<br />
John 2:13 13 And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, (KJV) <br />
<br />
John 6:4 4 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. (KJV) <br />
<br />
John 11:55 55 And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves. (KJV) <br />
<br />
These 3 passages show us that the writer of the Gospel of John disagreed with the writers of the Synoptic Gospels in that he thought that Jesus' career lasted three years (C. H. Guignebert, Jesus, 1956: NY. University Books, p. 205). <br />
<br />
From the material derived from Mark's gospel, it has been calculated that three to four weeks would suffice for everything related in Mark, with the exception of Mark 1:13 where Jesus was said to be in the wilderness for forty days (D.E. Nineham, Mark: The Pelican New Testament Commentaries, Penguin, 1963, revised, p. 35). This limits the length of Jesus ministry to only about two months and definitely less than one year. Other estimates range from a few months to the full three years of the Johanine itinerary (C. H. Guignebert, Jesus, 1956: NY. University Books, p. 211). The truth is that even such a basic information as the duration of his ministry is no longer available to us. The contradictory information derived from the gospels only served to underline this scarcity of certain knowledge about the ministry of Jesus. <br />
<br />
For the purpose of our study I want to elaborate upon a three-year ministry of Jesus as depicted by the writer of the Gospel of John. At the heart of our study we must remember we are examining the mythos of Jesus Christ and in particular the importance of the sacred number 33 which is derived from a 3 year ministry of Jesus which, according to Luke, began when Jesus was 30 years of age. <br />
<br />
The number 33 is a number that connects directly with the zodiac &amp; the movement of the sun around it. As mentioned above in prior articles, the sun takes 2,160 years to pass backward through one sign of 30 degrees of a sign of the Zodiac. Now this number 2160 or its shorter version 216, is a number that turns up in megalithic construction throughout the world. It was encoded into most of the cyclopean structures, to represent the Serpent or Sidereal Cults who were the Magi, or astrologers. Now it takes 2,160 years for the sun to clear a house as we have seen. In degrees this is 30. But the sun enters at the 30th degree but is not totally clear until the 33rd degree, as it is of a certain size also. <br />
<br />
Answer for yourself: Is this why the New Testament says the ministry of the Christ begins at 30 &amp; finishes at 33? If it can be proven that the depiction of the &quot;Jesus Story&quot; is nothing but the path of the Sun through the Zodiac then this makes perfect sense and is in keeping with the symbolism of the Zodiac. <br />
<br />
Today we have lost this knowledge but if read by one of the Ancient priest of Egypt or even one of the early Gnostic Jews or Gentile Gnostics this would not have escaped their attention. This reference would have been unmistakable to anyone aware of the secrets of astrology. The number is connected to the initiation of the 'sun' of god not 'son,' passing through the zodiac. <br />
<br />
Answer for yourself: Is this why the Freemasonic lodges also utilize the number? Most definitely. That is why they have a 33 degree Mason attainment. There are also 33 vertebrae in the spinal column. <br />
<br />
Of course one article does not a proof make so we continue our study to stack up the host of evidence that proves our point that the depiction of Jesus Christ in the New Testament and the &quot;Jesus Story&quot; in the New Testament is a &quot;literalization&quot; of the path of the Sun through the Zodiac.</div></div><hr />

We can't even know who rolled back the stone.<br />
<br />
Matthew  28:1-9  <br />
1 Now late on the Sabbath, when the dawn of the first day of the week was near, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the place where his body was. 2 And there was a great earth-shock; for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, rolling back the stone, took his seat on it. 3 His form was shining like the light, and his clothing was white as snow: 4 And for fear of him the watchmen were shaking, and became as dead men. 5 And the angel said to the women, Have no fear: for I see that you are searching for Jesus, who was put to death on the cross. 6 He is not here, for he has come to life again, even as he said. Come, see the Lord's resting-place.7 And go quickly and give his disciples the news that he has come back from the dead, and is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him, as I have said to you. 8 And they went away quickly, with fear and great joy, to give his disciples the news. 9 And on the way, Jesus came to them, saying, Be glad. And they came and put their hands on his feet, and gave him worship.<br />
 <br />
Mark 16:2-9<br />
2 And very early after dawn on the first day of the week, they came at the time of the coming up of the sun to the place where the body had been put. 3 And they were saying among themselves, Who will get the stone rolled away from the door for us? 4 And looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back; and it was of great size. 5 And when they went in, they saw a young man seated on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were full of wonder. 6 And he said to them, Do not be troubled: you are looking for Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been put to death on the cross; he has come back from the dead; he is not here: see, the place where they put him! 7 But go, say to his disciples and to Peter, He goes before you into Galilee: there you will see him, as he said to you. 8 And they went out quickly from the place, because fear and great wonder had come on them: and they said nothing to anyone, because they were full of fear that ...<br />
9 Now when he came back from the dead early on the first day of the week, he went first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had sent out seven evil spirits.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Luke 24:1-9<br />
1 But on the first day of the week, at dawn, they came to the place where his body had been put, taking the spices which they had got ready. 2 And they saw that the stone had been rolled away. 3 And they went in, but the body of the Lord Jesus was not there. 4 And while they were in doubt about it, they saw two men in shining clothing by them: 5 And while their faces were bent down to the earth in fear, these said to them, Why are you looking for the living among the dead? 6 He is not here, he has come back to life: have in mind what he said to you when he was still in Galilee, saying, 7 The Son of man will be given up into the hands of evil-doers, and be put to death on the cross, and on the third day he will come back to life. 8 And his words came back into their minds, 9 And they went away from that place and gave an account of all these things to the eleven disciples and all the others.<br />
 <br />
John 20:1-17<br />
1 Now on the first day of the week, very early, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the place and saw that the stone had been taken away from it. 2 Then she went running to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple who was loved by Jesus, and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the place of the dead and we have no knowledge where they have put him. 3 So Peter and the other disciple went out to the place of the dead. 4 They went running together, and the other disciple got in front of Peter and came first to the hole in the rock; 5 And looking in, he saw the linen bands on the earth; but he did not go in, 6 Then Simon Peter came after him and went into the hole in the rock; and he saw the linen bands on the earth, 7 And the cloth, which had been round his head, not with the linen bands but rolled up in a place by itself.8 Then the other disciple who came there first went in; and he saw and belief came to him. 9 For at that time they had no knowledge that the Writings said that he would have to come again from the dead. 10 So then the disciples went away again to their houses. 11 But Mary was still there outside the hole in the rock, weeping; and while she was weeping and looking into the hole, 12 She saw two angels in white seated where the body of Jesus had been, one at the head and the other at the feet. 13 They said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I have no knowledge where they have put him. 14 And then looking round, she saw Jesus there, but had no idea that it was Jesus. 15 Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? who are you looking for? She, taking him for the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have taken him away from here, say where you have put him and I will take him away.16 Jesus said to her, Mary! Turning, she said to him in Hebrew, Rabboni! (which is to say, Master). 17 Jesus said to her, Do not put your hand on me, for I have not gone up to the Father: but go to my brothers and say to them, I go up to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Also I read a very nice commen about John 20:17 <br />
  Jesus said to her, Do not put your hand on me, for I have not gone up to the Father: but go to my brothers and say to them, I go up to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.<br />
 <br />
Read what did this christian said<br />
