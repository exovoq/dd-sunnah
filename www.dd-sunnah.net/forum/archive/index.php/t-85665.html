 Imaam         Ali (r.a.)<br />
<br />
     It was     reported that Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) used     to repeat the following statement: &quot;The     best one after the Messenger of Allah (http://www.islamicweb.com/images/saws.gif) is Abu Bakr. And     the best one after Abu Bakr is Umar.&quot; He also whipped     those who claimed that he is better than Abu Bakr and Umar. [Ibn     Majah] <br />
      Imaam     Ali bin Abu-Talib (r.a.) said: &quot;The     Messenger of Allah called me and told me:     'You are alike with Jesus, Jews hated him till they slandered     his mother, and Christians loved him till they put him in the     position that is not for him.' With regard to     me, two categories of people will be ruined, namely he who     loves me too much and the love takes him away from     rightfulness, and he who hates me too much and the hatred     takes him away from rightfulness. Verily, I am not a prophet,     and there is nothing revealed to me. But I work with the Book     of Allah and the Sunnah of his Prophet (http://www.islamicweb.com/images/saws.gif) as much as I     can. So whatever I have asked you in regard of obeying Allah,     it is your duty to obey me whether you like it or not.&quot; [Ahmad]<br />
      Imaam     Ali (r.a.) said: &quot;There will     appear, at the end of time, people claimed to be from our     Shia but they are not from our Shia. They have a nickname     called Rawafid (rejecters). If you meet them then KILL     THEM for they are polytheist.&quot;<br />
      Imaam     Ali (r.a.) said: &quot;With regard to     me, two categories of people will be ruined, namely he who     loves me too much and the love takes him away from     rightfulness, and he who hates me too much and the hatred     takes him away from rightfulness. The best man with regard to     me is he who is on the middle course. So be with him and be     with the great majority (of Muslims) because Allah's hand (of     protection) is on keeping unity.&quot; [Nahjul     Balagha, sermon 126 about the Kharijites]<br />
      In the that time, people who     called them selves Muslims were three groups :<br />
      1- Kharijites who said that Imam Ali was a disbeliever and     they send Ibn Muljim to kill him and he did that.<br />
      2- Shia who said that he was infalleble Imam and Allah had     chosen him for leading Muslims.<br />
      3- Sunnies ( Majority of Muslims ) who said that he was a     great companion of the prophet and he was a great leader to     Muslims but Muslims had chosen him to be thier leader not     Allah.<br />
      Who are the people of the middle course &amp; the great     majority (of Muslims) as Imam Ali said in his sermon, Read     Imam Ali's words and then look to the three groups and you     will find the answer!<br />

 Imaam         Hasan bin Ali (r.a.)<br />
<br />
     'Aasim     bin Damrah said to Hasan bin Ali that the Shi`ites claim that     Ali will come back. Then Imaam Hasan said: &quot;Those     liers lied. If we had known that, his wives would not     have married (other men) nor     would we have shared his heritage.&quot;<br />
