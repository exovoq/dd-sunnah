&quot;When a woman has her regular flow of blood, the impurity of her monthly period will last seven days, and anyone who touches her will be unclean till evening. anything she lies on during her period will be unclean, and anything she sits on will be unclean. Whoever touches her bed must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean till evening. Whoever touches anything she sits on must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean till evening. Whether it is the bed or anything she was sitting on, when anyone touches it, he will be unclean till evening.&quot; Leviticus 15:19-23 <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not approach a woman to have sexual relations during the uncleanness of her monthly period.&quot; Leviticus 18:19</div></div><hr />
