<br />
I asked you for &quot;Proof&quot; - You got proof or not? <br />
<br />
And don't send me to any website to read stuff. Just tell me everything by email. <br />
<br />
Give me proof! That is, if you think you have any proof. And look, I know there is God, and I learned this without your religious instructions and I am convinced the Bible is the Word of God. <br />
<br />
My question is: <br />
<br />
Where is the proof that Mohammad was a prophet of the God of Abraham, Moses and David? Please don't beat about the bush.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for writing. Presently we are experiencing a very high level of email traffic. For this reason we are unable to give long, detailed and referenced answers to questions. <br />
<br />
From the tone of your letter I assume you have had ample time to read the resources I have spent years developing and putting on the Internet for just such occasions as this and to help anyone serious enough to take the time to read and learn more about the topics we are discussing. We receive thousands of emails asking many questions, both from the non-Muslims and from Muslims as well, all seeking to come to a better understanding about this one man and what he brought to the world we all live in today. <br />
<br />
The question you are asking about the proof of Muhammad, peace be upon him, is very much connected with the materials I have offered you. I will now assume you have reviewed this and we can safely say you are already in possession of the basic understanding and acceptance of belief in monotheism and the conclusions associated with this concept. <br />
<br />
Muhammad, peace be upon him, could neither read nor write in any language. He was well known amongst his tribe members as the most honest, most reliable, most respectable and most moral of anyone they knew. He was always held in high regard until when at the age of 40 years old, he received a visit from the Arch Angel Gabriel, while fasting and praying in a cave in a mountain outside of Makkah. <br />
<br />
The Angel commanded him to &quot;Recite&quot; and he replied saying, &quot;I am not a reciter&quot; and again he was commanded by the Angel to &quot;Recite&quot; - the Angel finally gave him the beginning of the Recitation (Quran - means recitation) and this continued for the next 23 years until the death of the prophet, peace be upon him. <br />
<br />
The story of Muhammad, peace be upon him, is one of the most documented of all the lives of all the humans on earth. He has been referred to as one of the most amazing of humans ever to live in the history of the world. The references are on the sites I have offered you. I am sure you have already verified these sources and are **************************** with them. <br />
<br />
he best evidence for establishing Muhammad, peace be upon him, as the prophet and servant of Allah, is to study the history of this man and realize what he was saying and what he brought to all of mankind - peace. While I realize many of the detractors of Islam would immediately try to deny this and even claim the opposite was true, I would simply say, let us look to the authentic and testable evidences still remaining with us today. <br />
<br />
This is one of the biggest of all statements to be made in this regard, &quot;We still have the proof with us today.&quot; <br />
<br />
Quran is memorized in every mosque in the world on a regular basis. This process is always done only in the Arabic language. Every Muslim on the earth knows at least some of the original words and grammar of the Quran and the way of putting it together correctly. All of us use on a daily basis. <br />
<br />
The Quran exists. <br />
<br />
(Let me further translate this for you) &quot;The Recitation that came to him in the cave 1,400 years ago, is still today learned by listening to it being recited and then committing it to memory - exactly the same way and only in the original Arabic language - word for word.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Quran does not change from generation to generation, or from country to country, nor from one civilization to another. No one has the authority to decide whether or not to add to or take away any part of the Quran, nor to authorize a new way to organize, categorize or restructure the layout, order or method of reciting and memorizing it. <br />
<br />
It is estimated over 20,000,000 (twenty million) people living today, have memorized the Quran from cover to cover, chapter for chapter, line for line and word for word. At the risk of sounding a bit redundant, I again mention to you, this is all in classical Arabic language without any changes from one country to another or from one society to another. All of this and keep in mind please, eighty eight per cent (88%) of all Muslims do not speak Arabic, except for the Quran. <br />
<br />
There are no &quot;versions&quot; of the Quran. Translations are never considered to be the actual Quran and are rejected by all scholars as being the same as the original. We still have the original, so why would we need to apologize and try to reconcile different &quot;versions&quot; of manu************************s or scrolls of the Quran, when we always have the entire Quran in Arabic in the minds and hearts of so many millions of people. <br />
<br />
Here are a few points for consideration (taken from our websites): <br />
<br />
Quran exists today as it did 1,400 years ago <br />
Quran is recited today in the same classical Arabic as it was in the seventh century, A.D. <br />
Quran contains amazing amount of knowledge not known to the people of those days. <br />
Quran has prophecies and predictions many of which have already come to pass. <br />
Quran memorized by more people than any other book on the planet. <br />
Quran is recited by more people than any other book there is. <br />
Quran has no mistakes, errors, corruptions or interpolations <br />
Quran cannot be replicated. <br />
Quran parts also can not be replicated. <br />
Consider this, while Muslims have succumbed to the practice of dividing up into groups and sects, all of them still agree there is only ONE QURAN and it is in the classical Arabic, and it must be recited as an Arabic Recitation to be considered authentic. <br />
<br />
Reflect on the main theme of the Quran and what it enjoins on those who are guided by it: &quot;Worship God, alone without any partners and live the moral life of one who is in total surrender, submission, obedience, sincerity and peace with Almighty God, while giving all the creation proper respect and granting all people their rights. <br />
<br />
Now keep in mind, I am not employed by anyone to produce this material and answer personal inquires about my life and my beliefs, and yet I do try to reply back to as many of the thousands of emails as I can. I have taken the time (twice) to reply back to you in the most respectful and honorable manner. I have offered the works of myself and a number of others working alongside me for your own examination. You are most welcome to visit the sources again and reflect for yourself and then make up your own mind whether or not this is something for you to continue researching.  <br />
<br />
There is an easy test you can preform yourself. For anyone who is already believing in God, all they have to do is go deep down inside your own heart and ask the One who created you in the first place for His guidance and if you are guided then you don't need to worry about it any more. <br />
<br />
If you have any further questions requiring research or discussions please feel free to direct them to one of our senior scholars, such as Salem Alamry <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7f0c1e131e120d063f17100b121e1613511c10122b17160c">[email&#160;protected]</a> e-mail address is being protected from spam bots, you need Java************************ enabled to view it <br />

Peace and guidance from Above be unto you and your family, <br />
