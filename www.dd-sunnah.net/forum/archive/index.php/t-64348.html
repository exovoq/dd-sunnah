<br />
I have a friend who is originally from Pakistan. I know in Pakistan they have all sort of groups and &quot;Math-hab&quot; , My friend is a sunni person but i think her family believe in things that are wrong. She has recently performed Omrah for the first time.  Before going to KSA they went to Syria.. here is what she said in her email<br />
<br />
&quot;<br />
We actually first went to Syria, Damascus where we saw some places where the prophets wife Zainab and where Bilaal (do u say Peace be upon him) is buried. We also visited the mosque where the Prophet Mohammed(sawws)  will be resurrected. It was a beautiful mosque&quot;<br />
<br />
I need to maybe buy her few books or point out articles on the net to correct her given information about islam.  They live in England and that trip must have cost them a fortune.<br />
<br />
Can you help me please?</div></div><hr />

Here's a couple of links, on the basics of Tawhid. I hope they're useful. I'm sure the brothers will pitch in few more insha Allah<br />
