'The Hidden Tyranny Revealed'<br />
<br />
A tran************************ of three AMERICAN DISSIDENT VOICES radio programs. For further information, write National Vanguard Books, Box 330, Hillsboro WV 24946.<br />
<br />
Editor's note: Because of its importance for every patriot's understanding of American history, we offer this special tran************************ of the complete text of our three broadcasts based on Benjamin H. Freedman's The Hidden Tyranny. Mr. Freedman's writing style does not lend itself well to the medium of radio. Hence, I have edited some of his passages solely for the purpose of greater clarity. In a few cases I have corrected obvious typographical errors. I have rendered his clumsy phrase, Talmudists ('Jews'), simply as Talmudist Jews. In no case have I consciously changed his meaning. If there is sufficient interest and support, National Vanguard Books will reprint The Hidden Tyranny as a booklet, with the full and exact text as composed by Mr. Freedman. -- K. A. Strom<br />

<br />
Program of 15th October, 1994<br />
<br />
Today I am going to introduce to you a man whose insights and revelations are of the highest importance to the future of our nation and people, a man who is reviled and hated by the enemies of America, and a man who for over half a century was at the very center of the hidden power which created Communism and which now misrules the United States. Benjamin H. Freedman was born in 1890, and, by an ironic twist of fate, the delivering physician at his birth was Dr. Simon Baruch, the father of arch-conspirator against America, Wall Street speculator, and advisor and handler of U.S. Presidents from World War I to 1965, Mr. Bernard M. Baruch. In Mr. Freedman's own words, writing during the years of the Nixon ********************istration: Mr. Bernard Baruch was a good friend of this author's family and would very often consult this author.... [I] have been in a position since 1912 to witness what was going on behind the scenes. This author served on the National Democratic Committee in the 1912 campaign that elected President Wilson to his first term. No doors have been closed to this author since then. <br />
Benjamin Freedman was raised in a Jewish family and brought up in the Jewish religion. He lived in New York City, and was a wealthy and very successful businessman, eventually becoming the principal owner of the Woodbury Soap Company. He was a witness to and to some extent a participant in the political and financial manipulations that resulted in the rise of Communism, the establishment of Israel as a Zionist state, and the Jewish domination of American politics and American media. As an agent of Jewish interests, he had access to and interviewed at length seven presidents of the United States. After the end of the War to Impose the New World Order in 1945, Mr. Freedman became convinced that he had a responsibility to speak out. He had been an agent of, and privy to the councils of, the Judaeo-Communist apparatus which was at that time about to launch two of its greatest projects: the creation of a one-world government under the name United Nations, and the establishment of Israel as a Zionist state over the dead bodies of thousands of Palestinians. He had been concerned over the increasing power of his co-religionists, and their irresponsible use of that power, for some time. He broke with Judaism and became a convert to Catholicism. His scholarship and research in the field of Jewish origins led him to believe that the popular conceptions about Jews and Judaism were so manifestly false that the words themselves should be rejected. In his writings you will often find him referring to so-called or self-styled Jews or to Talmudists, meaning the followers of the Talmud, a holy book of modern Judaism. <br />
<br />
In 1946 he founded the League for Peace and Justice in Palestine. Arnold Forster, a high official of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith or ADL, in his 1988 autobiography Square One, called Benjamin Freedman an affluent, apostate, self-hating Jew. The magazine Commentary (published by the American Jewish Committee) for February, 1955, referred to him as Jewish anti-Semite Benjamin Freedman. Freedman himself stated in 1954: The word anti-Semitism is another word which should be eliminated from the English language. [The word] anti-Semitism serves only one purpose today. It is used as a smear word. When so-called or self-styled Jews feel that anyone opposes any of their objectives they discredit their victims by applying the word anti-Semite or anti-Semitic through all the channels they have at their command and under their control. I can speak with great authority on that subject. Because so-called or self-styled Jews were unable to disprove my public statements in 1946 with regard to the situation in Palestine, they spent millions of dollars to smear me as an anti-Semite hoping thereby to discredit me in the eyes of the public who were very much interested in what I had to say. Until 1946 I was a little saint to all so-called or self-styled Jews. When I disagreed with them publicly on the Zionist intentions in Palestine I became suddenly Anti-Semite No. 1. Benjamin H. Freedman was in truth a defector from the forces which have been working to destroy our Republic and our civilization. Let us see what he had to say. Today we will be exploring Mr. Freedman's amazing book The Hidden Tyranny, published in the early 1970s. The following are the words of Mr. Freedman: The names of Presidents Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon will certainly be found one day inscribed in big red letters in the official annals of the rise and fall of the United States. These seven masters of deception incurred their guilt by debasing their solemn oaths of office on behalf of undisclosed domestic and foreign principals without any apparent qualms or misgivings, to enhance their political fortunes totally oblivious to the threat to United States security and survival. ...The disclosures which follow here are now revealed for the first time anywhere. They now expose for the first time to the grass roots population of the United States the secret un-American, non-American, and anti-American strategy to which these seven masters of deception knowingly subscribed. ...Very early in their political careers, these seven masters of deception... acquired their proficient skill in detecting on which side their political bread was buttered. ...Throughout their political careers [they] demonstrated that political shrewdness invariably identified with the immoral dogma of 20th century politicians who preach and practice any means justifies all ends. Accordingly, future grass roots populations of the United States will one day find inscribed in the history of the rise and fall of the United States the verdict that the means ...advocated by these seven masters of deception were primarily responsible for the end of the United States. It is today a well recognized fact of life in political circles in the United States that the censorship exercised by Zionists over the media for mass information constitutes a virtual monopoly. It is likewise today a well recognized fact of life in political circles in the United States since President Wilson won his first election in 1912 as President of the United States, that elections in the United States are seldom won or lost today based upon the candidates' qualification for office. Elections in the United States since 1912 are won or lost on the battlefields of the media for mass information.... Zionist ownership of media for mass communication, or by Zionist control exercised by some devious corporate device, in effect and in fact censors the news and editorial policies of all the leading daily and Sunday newspapers, all the weekly and monthly news magazines, all leading radio and television stations and networks, the entire motion picture industry, the entire entertainment world and the entire book publishing industry, in effect and in fact the entire complex of media for mass information in the United States, truly a brainwashing monopoly. <br />
<br />
As a result of that condition in the United States, for approximately the past fifty years the grass roots population of the United States has only read, heard and seen what passed Zionist censorship and best served Zionist objectives.... The Zionist-ruled media for mass information in the United States never informed the grass roots population... how and why President Woodrow Wilson lied the United States into the desperate predicament in which the United States now finds itself in the Middle East. ...The United States declared war against Germany on April 6, 1917. On April 2, 1917, President Wilson addressed both houses of Congress and pleaded with them to declare war against Germany. President Wilson's appeal to Congress... was primarily President Wilson's liquidation of his obligation to his blackmailers. The following incontestable facts confirm that conclusion beyond all question of any doubt. President Wilson's hand trembled as he read his address. The members of Congress present had no reason to suspect why President Wilson's hand trembled. ...By the time President Wilson finished reading his appeal to Congress, many of his listeners were in tears but not for the reason the grass roots population of the United States today will be in tears when they finish reading this manu************************. ...Congress only declared war against Germany because President Wilson informed Congress that a German submarine had sunk the S.S. Sussex in the English channel in violation of international law and that United States citizens aboard the S.S. Sussex had perished with the ship. <br />
<br />
After General Pershing's troops were fighting in Europe, the hoax was exposed. ...The S.S. Sussex had not been sunk and no United States citizens had lost their lives. The United States was now at war in Europe as Great Britain's ally. That is what Great Britain and the Talmudist Jews of the world conspired to achieve in their crooked diplomatic underworld. The discovery of the hoax by the British Navy shocked many honorable Englishmen. ...The S.S. Sussex was available for anyone to visit who might care to do so to see the S.S. Sussex for themselves with their own eyes. In that war the United States mobilized 4,734,991 men to serve in the armed forces, of whom 115,516 were killed and 202,002 were either injured or maimed for life. This author crossed the English Channel many times on the S.S. Sussex. The alleged sinking of the S.S. Sussex was the figment of an over-worked Zionist imagination. <br />
<br />
Shortly after President Wilson's first inauguration, President Wilson received a visitor in the White House by [the name of] Mr. Samuel Untermeyer. Mr. Untermeyer was a prominent New York City (Jewish -Ed.) attorney who contributed generously to the National Democratic Committee that installed President Wilson in the White House.... Mr. Untermeyer surprised President Wilson when he finally stated what brought him to the White House. Mr. Untermeyer informed President Wilson that he had been retained to bring a breach of promise action against President Wilson. Mr. Untermeyer informed President Wilson that his client was willing to accept $40,000 in lieu of commencing the breach of promise action. Mr. Untermeyer's client was the former wife of a professor at Princeton University at the same time President Wilson was a professor at Princeton University. Mr. Untermeyer produced a packet of letters from his pocket, written by President Wilson to his colleague's wife when they were neighbors at Princeton University. These letters established the illicit relationship which had existed between President Wilson and the wife of his colleague neighbor. President Wilson had written many endearing letters to the wife of his colleague, many of which she never destroyed. President Wilson ac?know?ledged his authorship of the letters after examining a few of them. President Wilson left Princeton University to become the Governor of New Jersey. In 1912 President Wilson was elected to his first term as President of the United States. In the interim, President Wilson's former sweetheart had divorced her husband and married again. Her second husband resided in Washington with a grown son who was in the employ of one of the leading banks in Washington. Mr. Untermeyer explained to President Wilson that his former sweetheart was very fond of her husband's son. Mr. Untermeyer explained that this son was in financial trouble. This son suddenly needed $40,000, as he told the story, to liquidate a pressing liability to the bank for which he worked. The details are not relevant here except that the son needed the $40,000 badly and he needed it quickly. President Wilson's former sweetheart thought that President Wilson was the logical prospect for that $40,000 to help her husband's son. ...President Wilson expressed himself as very fortunate that his former sweetheart went to Mr. Untermeyer to seek his assistance. The publicity could have proved very embarrassing to President Wilson if his former sweetheart had instead consulted a Republican attorney. <br />
<br />
President Wilson quickly set Mr. Untermeyer's mind at rest by informing Mr. Untermeyer that he did not have $40,000 available for any purpose. Mr. Untermeyer suggested that President Wilson should think the matter over.... Mr. Untermeyer returned to President Wilson a few days later as they had agreed. President Wilson did not hesitate to inform Mr. Untermeyer that he did not have the $40,000 to pay his blackmailer. President Wilson appeared irritated. Mr. Untermeyer considered the matter a few moments and then volunteered a solution to President Wilson for his problem. Mr. Untermeyer volunteered to give President Wilson's former sweetheart the $40,000 out of his own pocket on one condition. Mr. Untermeyer's condition was that President Wilson promise Mr. Untermeyer to appoint to the first vacancy on the United States Supreme Court a nominee to be recommended to President Wilson by Mr. Untermeyer. Without further talk, President Wilson accepted Mr. Untermeyer's generous offer. Mr. Untermeyer promptly paid $40,000 in currency to President Wilson's former sweetheart. The contemplated breach of promise suit was never heard of after that. Mr. Untermeyer retained in his possession permanently the packet of letters.... President Wilson was most grateful to Mr. Untermeyer for everything he was doing to solve his problem. Mr. Untermeyer was a man of great wealth. The law firm in New York of which Mr. Untermeyer was the leading partner, Messrs. Guggenheim, Untermeyer, and Marshall, is still today one of the nation's most prominent and prosperous law firms. Mr. Untermeyer organized the Bethlehem Steel Company for his friend Mr. Charles M. Schwab. ...Mr. Untermeyer paid $40,000 ...out of his own pocket in the hope it might bring to pass a dream close to his heart, a Talmudist Jew on the United States Supreme Court where none ever served. The day soon arrived when President Wilson was presented with the necessity of appointing a new member of the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Untermeyer recommended Louis Dembitz Brandeis for the vacancy. President Wilson immediately appointed him.... President Wilson and Justice Brandeis became unusually intimate friends. Justice Brandeis knew the circumstances of his appointment by President Wilson.... <br />
<br />
In 1914 Justice Brandeis was the most prominent and most politically influential of all Zionists in the United States. ...Justice Brandeis volunteered his opinion to President Wilson that the sinking of the S.S. Sussex by a German submarine in the English channel with the loss of lives of United States citizens justified the declaration of war against Germany by the United States. Relying to a great extent upon the legal opinion of Justice Brandeis, President Wilson... appealed to Congress to declare war against Germany and they did on April 6, 1917. The declaration of war against Germany by the United States guaranteed [to] the Talmudist Jews throughout the world that Palestine was to be turned over to them upon the defeat of Germany. The defeat of Germany was certain if the United States could be railroaded into the war in Europe as Great Britain's ally. Prior to the October 1916 London Agreement, Talmudist Jews throughout the world were pro-German. The German Emancipation Edict of 1822 guaranteed Talmudist Jews in Germany all civil rights enjoyed by Germans. ...Germany was the only country in Europe which did not place restrictions on Talmudist Jews.... Talmudist Jews throughout the world were informed by cable from London about the October 1916 London Agreement. That information transformed Talmudist Jews throughout the world from pro-German to pro-British. Great Britain placed at the disposal of Talmudist Jews in London their secret codes and worldwide cable facilities to inform Talmudist Jews throughout the world about Great Britain's pledge to turn over Palestine to them as compensation for railroading the United States into the war in Europe as Great Britain's ally.... <br />
<br />
On April 6, 1917, President Wilson and Justice Brandeis knew something the grass roots population of the United States did not know. [They] knew the declaration of war by the United States against Germany discharged President Wilson from his obligation to his blackmailers.... There was seldom any address made to Congress that stirred the people of the United States and the world, as President Wilson's April 2, 1917, plea to Congress to declare war against Germany. President Wilson was aware when he addressed Congress that Germany had not committed any act against the United States which justified a declaration of war.... This author at that time knew President Wilson was informed to that effect before President Wilson made his plea to Congress.... Ladies and gentlemen, what you have been listening to is an excerpt from Jewish author Benjamin H. Freedman's manu************************ entitled The Hidden Tyranny. We will continue with more amazing revelations by Mr. Freedman of the inner workings of the power elite on our next American Dissident Voices program. Won't you help us in our patriotic work? Americans are apathetic and confused because they are misinformed and do not understand the nature of the tyranny that is destroying our country and our way of life. Alone among patriotic groups, we dare to tell the whole truth which the American people need to hear. You can make a real contribution to the future of your children and grandchildren and countless generations yet to come by supporting this program -- to say nothing of the priceless education which you and your friends and family can receive. But this program is not free. We are totally dependent on the support of patriots like you to keep it on the air. It costs money, a great deal of money, to pay for the airing of this program every week. And it takes a great deal of money to publish the unique books we offer which are available nowhere else because of the dead hand of censorship in this land. We have a list of vital books which we would like to publish, but must wait for the availability of the funds to do so. In my opinion, Benjamin Freedman's book, long out of print, deserves to see the light of day again. If you will help us with a donation of $22 or more this week, I will send you a copy of our latest video tape featuring Dr. William Pierce, the Chairman of the National Alliance and a frequent speaker on this program. On this full color one-hour television program, recorded live in Richmond, Virginia, earlier this year, Dr. Pierce delves deeply into the political and social issues affecting White Americans, and answers live viewers' questions on a wide variety of topics. We offer this video as our Radio Offer Number 26, for any donation of $22 or more to National Vanguard Books, Department R, PO Box 90, Hillsboro WV 24946 USA. Remember to tell us the call letters of this station when you write and remember to ask for Radio Offer Number 26. We are here for you. Will you be there for us, now, while we still have the freedom to speak? Until the next broadcast, this is Kevin Alfred Strom reminding you that equal men are not free.<br />

Program of 22nd October, 1994<br />
<br />
Today we continue the amazing revelations of one of the most astounding individuals of the 20th century, a man whose memory and writings have been almost entirely obliterated from the consciousness of most Americans. I am speaking of Benjamin H. Freedman, a man who was from the period of World War I until 1946 a member of the Jewish financial establishment which during those years instigated and funded Communist revolutions, subverted the American government, and sent American boys to die in wars for Zionist and Communist objectives. Benjamin H. Freedman was a defector. He defected to the American side. And his story deserves to be told. Being of Jewish birth, he cannot be smeared as an anti-Semite. And having been a wealthy insider and witness to the machinations of America's enemies, his insights are of the highest value to all who would understand how America has fallen so low. On our last program, we detailed his revelations of how Woodrow Wilson was manipulated by organized Jewry to bring America into World War I. When the British Empire was in desperate straits during that war, Zionist Jews dangled before the British government the possibility of using their influence in the United States to bring America into the war on Britain's side. Their price was a promise from Britain to cede Palestine to the Zionists after the war. Using their knowledge of a sordid instance of adultery in Woodrow Wilson's past, they forced him to appoint a Jew to the United States Supreme Court and forced him to send hundreds of thousands of young American soldiers to be crippled and killed in a war that did not concern the United States at all. Let us continue with these revelations from an insider in a position to know. The following are the words of Benjamin H. Freedman: In referring to the declaration of war against Germany by the United States, Sir Winston Churchill said in an interview with a prominent editor published in Scribner's Commentator in 1936.... &quot;America should have minded her own business and stayed out of the World War. If you hadn't entered the war the Allies would have made peace with Germany in the Spring of 1917.&quot; <br />
<br />
Germany's peace offer to Great Britain asked for neither indemnities nor reparations. Germany offered to restore the territorial status and political independence of every country with whom Great Britain was at war, as they existed in August 1914 when the war in Europe started. Germany demanded no benefits. Germany's October 1916 peace offer was on the table before the British War Cabinet. Germany's... peace offer needed only one signature to end the war. Great Britain would have quickly accepted... if the World Zionist Organization had not interfered..... When the British War Cabinet decided to accept Germany's October 1916 peace offer, the World Zionist Organization offered to railroad the United States into the war in Europe as Great Britain's ally if Great Britain promised the Talmudist Jews of the world Palestine as compensation after Germany's defeat.... Talmudist Jew pressure in London and Talmudist Jew pressure in New York prevailed. President Wilson had little choice in the matter it seemed. President Wilson was the captive of circumstances in his early life that could not be altered. President Wilson's April 2, 1917, address to Congress was about to decide the fate of the world. ...Germans regarded [these activities] as a double-cross by Talmudist Jews.... Talmudist Jews promise[d the] Germans victory, then stab[bed] them in the back.... The Kaiser provided the World Zionist Organization with the offices for their world headquarters in Berlin. The Kaiser, his family, and government officials were constantly extending assistance to Theodor Herzl [Note: Theodor Herzl, 1860-1904, was the founder of modern Zionism and the leader of the World Zionist Organization. -- Ed.]. Germany extended opportunities to Talmudist Jews not available in other European countries. The Kaiser himself arranged the personal meeting between the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and Theodor Herzl. Bleichroder and Company in Berlin were the private bankers of the Kaiser's family for generations. They were Talmudist Jews. Warburg and Company of Hamburg were the world's largest merchant bankers. They were Talmudist Jews. The head of the German General Electric Company, then the world's largest industrial enterprise, was a Talmudist Jew. The attitude of Germans toward Talmudist Jews in Germany and throughout the world worsened much after the October 1916 stab in the back.... <br />
<br />
Talmudist Jews throughout the world made bad matters worse on August 7, 1933, when [they] declared their holy war to destroy the German nation by destroying their export trade upon which their very existence depends. Under the leadership of Mr. Samuel Untermeyer, Talmudist Jews of the world declared a boycott on all German goods and services. They asked their Christian friends to join their worldwide boycott.... Mr. Samuel Untermeyer arranged for the International Boycott Conference in Amsterdam in July 1933. Mr. Untermeyer was elected there the president of the World Jewish Economic Federation..... The New York Times of August 7, 1933, published the Talmudist Jews' declaration of their holy war against Germany in a three-column report of Mr. Untermeyer's address to the nation from Columbia Broadcasting Company's studio on the night of his arrival home from Europe. Mr. Untermeyer among other things stated: &quot; [The] holy war in which we are embarked... is a war which must be waged unremittingly.... &quot; ...the Jews are the aristocrats of the world.... &quot;...[This] economic boycott against all German goods, shipping, and services... is our only really effective weapon... [to] bring the German people to their senses by destroying their export trade on which their very existence depends... we shall force them to learn... we will drive the last nail in the coffin....&quot; This statement was made on August 7, 1933, when not a hair on the head of a Talmudist Jew in all Germany had been touched. Germany was plunged into a depression difficult to describe in a few words, Germany's export business suddenly ending as if by magic. Talmudist Jews hoped [in] that way to stop Germans from continuing to talk about why they lost the war. The eminent Rabbi Maurice L. Perlman, head of the British section of the World Jewish Congress, stated to a Canadian audience as reported by the Toronto Evening Telegram of February 26, 1940, that The World Jewish Congress has been at war with Germany for seven years. President Roosevelt was a captive of the Talmudist Jews from the time he went to Albany as Governor of the State of New York. ...President Roosevelt railroaded the United States into the Second World War. <br />
<br />
Germany and Poland had agreed upon a formula giving Germany access across the Danzig Corridor. President Wilson in 1919 created the Danzig Corridor which separated Germany into two halves... separated by a strip of German territory granted to Poland ...in order to keep Germany weak... at the instigation of Talmudist Jews at the Versailles Peace Conference.... Crossing the Danzig Corridor from western Germany to eastern Germany or vice versa was like traveling from one country to another country. [Due to] the inconveniences, the delays and annoyances, Germany and Poland had finally worked out their acceptable arrangement that eliminated a majority of German objections to the Danzig Corridor. Germany and Poland reached a basis that would serve to prevent Germany's resort to more aggressive action. Adolf Hitler was the head of the German government at the time. Talmudist Jews throughout the world opposed the peaceful adjustment between Germany and Poland of the Danzig Corridor situation. Unrestricted access of traffic between the western half and eastern half of Germany would soon make Germany again the most powerful country in the world. Talmudist Jews throughout the world dreaded the thought. Shortly before the agreement with Germany was to be signed, Poland secretly signed a treaty with Great Britain dated August 25, 1939. Great Britain agreed in that treaty to hasten to the military assistance of Poland ...if Poland were attacked by Germany. With that assurance from Great Britain, Poland broke off negotiations with Germany. Germany did not understand the reason for Poland's sudden change of mind and decided to proceed with the terms of arrangement agreed upon with Poland. That was the start of World War II. Great Britain knowingly deceived Poland when [they] promised military assistance.... Great Britain could not come to Poland's assistance and Great Britain knew it when [the] offer of military assistance... was made. Poland's unexplained discontinuance of negotiations with Germany to complete the Danzig Corridor agreement resulted in Germany's troops moving into the Danzig Corridor without an agreement with Poland. Great Britain knew exactly what would take place in that event, that it would mean the beginning of World War II. The rest is history. Talmudist Jews of the world welcomed a war against Germany in 1939.... President Roosevelt tried his hardest in 1939 to railroad the United States into the war in Europe to accommodate Talmudist Jews in the United States. Germany learned by experience in World War I that the entry of the United States into the war in Europe in 1939 could prove equally disastrous to Germany.... Germany exercised extraordinary caution not to provide the United States with justification under international law to declare war against Germany. That situation presented President Roosevelt with a problem. President Roosevelt decided if it were impossible for him to get into the war in Europe through the front door that he would railroad the United States into the war in Europe through the back door. Through the back door meant through Japan. ...Germany and Japan had a treaty under which if either Germany or Japan were attacked by a third power, the country which was not attacked by the third power automatically is at war with that third power. President Roosevelt planned to provoke Japan so Japan would attack the United States. Japan in December 1941 attacked Pearl Harbor. The United States immediately declared war against Japan and automatically was at war with Germany. The personal diary of the Honorable Mr. Henry L. Stimson and all his papers are in Yale University library. Mr. Stimson each day entered in his personal diary in his own handwriting the important events in his life that day. Mr. Stimson was President Roosevelt's Secretary of War. Mr. Stimson's diary was introduced as evidence in the United States Senate investigation of the Pearl Harbor attack by Japan over the strong objections of friends of President Roosevelt. Mr. Stimson entered in his diary on November 25, 1941, two weeks before Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, that at a meeting with President Roosevelt and his Cabinet that morning at the White House, President Roosevelt told those present that he wished to be at war against Japan but that he did not want it to appear that the United States fired the first shot. ...President Roosevelt advised Japan they could purchase no more steel scrap or oil from the United States. Japan was in the midst of a war against China. Without scrap steel and without oil Japan would be unable to continue that war. Japan was totally dependent upon the United States for both steel scrap and oil. ...President Roosevelt knowingly provoked Japan to attack the United States. <br />

President Harry S. Truman made his great contribution to the desperate predicament in which the United States today finds itself in the Middle East when he recognized as a sovereign state an armed uprising in Palestine by 800,000 armed aliens transplanted into Palestine in a conspiracy organized by Talmudist Jews throughout the world. President Truman in 1946 suffered from a pathological obsession that he must be elected President of the United States in 1948 on his own account. Mr. Clark M. Clifford [Note: Clark M. Clifford, 1907- , attorney (Clifford and Warnke) and tired old establishment war horse, was the architect of Truman's 1948 campaign and himself a strong advocate of recognizing Israel. He also co-wrote the National Security Act, which created the Central Intelligence Agency; organized the transition between the Eisenhower and Kennedy ********************istrations; and, until succeeded by Nicholas Katzenbach in 1991, was chairman of First American Bankshares, which had links to the infamous Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI). He defended BCCI twice; in 1978 against the SEC regarding BCCI's takeover of Financial General Bankshares; and in 1989 against drug-related money-laundering charges in Florida. In the latter case, BCCI paid a $15 million fine; Clifford's retainer was $45.3 million. On July 29, 1992, Clifford was indicted on ten counts by a federal grand jury for his involvement in the BCCI affair. -- Ed.], Secretary of Defense under President Lyndon B. Johnson, deserves a great deal of credit for the recognition of the State of Israel on May 14, 1948, by the United States. Mr. Eliahu Epstein, the United States representative of the Jewish Agency in Washington in 1948, told the story in his three page article in the Jewish Chronicle of London in its 10th Anniversary issue... celebrating the founding of the State of Israel. Mr. Clifford undoubtedly was anxious to help because President Truman had confided in his close friends that he wished to recognize the Zionist state in the first hour of its birth as he did. The State of Israel was officially proclaimed in Tel Aviv at midnight on May 14, 1948. President Truman recognized the State of Israel eleven minutes after midnight. President Truman finally advised this author that he did not wish to carry on the discussion of the Zionist question with him any further. He wrote to this author that he had turned over the entire Palestine question to the Honorable David Niles. Talmudist Jews were willing to carry out their part of the bargain with President Truman.... Although the odds in President Truman's election were 20 to 1 against his election, President Truman romped home the winner over Governor Dewey assisted by the invisible and invincible Zionist political steam-roller that always elects their candidates. President Truman not only used the power and prestige of the United States to compel the United Nations to admit the State of Israel as a peace loving nation... but he made billions of United States taxpayer dollars available to Talmudist Jews to make the State of Israel powerful. When the day to vote for the admission of the State of Israel arrived, they were short two votes. The plan was about to collapse. In the emergency Mr. Charles H. Silver engaged Cardinal Spellman to make two trips to South America to change their votes in the United Nations.... The newspapers around the world on June 11, 1964, published Mr. Silver's confession of a secret I have kept for fifteen years. The secret Cardinal Spellman kept with Mr. Silver was that Cardinal Spellman was sent to South America by Mr. Silver on behalf of the Talmudist Jews in New York.... This author was a close personal friend of Cardinal Spellman for twenty-five years. Cardinal Spellman confessed to this author several years ago that he felt he had committed an irreparable sin by conspiring with the Talmudist Jews... to elect the State of Israel as a member of the United Nations. In the midst of that bloody fighting in the Middle East in June 1967, Cardinal Spellman told this author when alone with him in his study that he felt personally responsible for all the lives lost in the 1967 invasion of the United Arab Republic and Syria by the State of Israel. ----<br />

You have been listening to the words of Jewish author Benjamin H. Freedman, a few excerpts from his hard-to-find manu************************ The Hidden Tyranny. Mr. Freedman, who was born in 1890, was a witness to Zionist machinations for decades at the very highest level, but after the Judaeo-Communist victory in 1945 he became disgusted with the chicanery of his co-racialists and broke with the Jewish elite, and spent a substantial portion of his sizable fortune in an attempt to bring the truth to Americans. If you are curious why this Jewish author, Benjamin Freedman, invariably uses the term Talmudist Jews, you'll have to tune in to our next program. Won't you please support our efforts to bring these hidden truths to the American people? America is today an occupied nation, a victim of the ruthless aliens whose activities we detailed today. As a result of the control of our institutions and our media by these aliens, Americans have been conditioned to accept a moral code in which anything that tends to the extinction of our race is considered good, and anything which tends to our survival is regarded as evil. The situation we face is an emergency, and we must unite for the survival of our kind and the nation our forefathers bled and died for. Our only chance for success is if the concerned Americans who are hearing my voice, who know that our nation has been on the wrong track for many years, will reach out to us, and respond to the opportunities for patriotic education and action which we offer. The window of truly free speech opened in 1776 may soon be closing if the present rulers of America have their way. If that happens, then all patriotic resistance will have to be underground resistance. If you will do nothing now, how likely is it that you will act when the Iron Curtain has completely descended? I ask all those who are made of the stuff with which this nation was formed to write to me today and join our crusade for truth. Despite the fact that our nation is being bled white by foreign aid to Israel, the new Communist Haiti and Communist South Africa, and other foreign tyrannies; despite the fact that our people have been demoralized by anti-White propaganda lies on their televisions and in their newspapers every day for over a quarter century; despite the fact that the burden of supporting the growing non-White underclass has drained the American people of so much money that it would buy and rebuild the 500 largest corporations in the country with money to spare; despite all these things, the genius and hard work of our people have created the most advanced civilization ever to exist on this planet and so far as we know, possibly in the universe. Imagine what we could achieve if we regained our freedom, the freedom to be ourselves. I'll leave you with that thought. We can achieve such a future. It is up to you. If you will educate yourself and awaken others of your acquaintance, you will make that possible future a reality. Of course, if you are satisfied with the present course of our nation, you need do nothing. Those of you who are still with me, I ask you tonight to send for our Radio Offer Number 4. It is the equivalent of a graduate course in history and modern political and social realities. One of our new supporters wrote and told me that after receiving this book, he found it to be more enlightening than all his graduate and post-graduate courses in history and political science combined. The book I am speaking of is entitled The Best of Attack and National Vanguard and it is a collection of the very best articles from our patriotic newspaper from over a twelve-year period. This is no ordinary book. Its 217 illustrated, newspaper-sized pages are filled with meticulously documented facts which the enemies of our nation most definitely do not want you to read. If you have the courage to examine what it has been our life's work to bring to light, then send a gift of $25 or more to keep this program on the air, and ask for our Radio Offer Number 4. Our address is National Vanguard Books, Department R, PO Box 90, Hillsboro WV 24946 USA. Remember to give us the call letters of this radio station when you write, and remember to ask for Radio Offer Number 4. Until next time, this is Kevin Alfred Strom reminding you that freedom is not free.<br />

Program of 29th October, 1994<br />
<br />
Welcome to the third and final installment of our series on the amazing revelations of that insider to the forces which are destroying the United States of America, that insider who broke with those forces and exposed their machinations, Jewish financier and writer Benjamin H. Freedman. We have been following the revelations of Mr. Freedman from his hard-to-find manu************************ The Hidden Tyranny which details the means by which seven Presidents of the United States -- Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon -- betrayed the American people to Zionist interests. Remember that Benjamin Freedman was more than just an historian researching these facts among the dry documents of yesterday -- he was a participant in history, and he was personally acquainted with Zionist leaders and every one of the seven Presidents whose actions he chronicles. Today we pick up this important document where we left off on our last broadcast. Remember as you hear these words that this document was written in 1971. The following are the words of Benjamin Freedman: The story of how President Dwight D. Eisenhower lied the United States into the desperate predicament in which the United States today finds itself in the Middle East is not a complicated story. Talmudist Jews in the United States pressured President Eisenhower into sponsoring... House Joint Resolution 117 on January 5, 1957. President Eisenhower knew less about what he was then doing than a new born babe. It was pitiful for this author to witness a great General being figuratively pushed around by Talmudist Jews unfit to shine his shoes. President Eisenhower was always friendly towards this author. This author met President Eisenhower when he was being considered by Mr. Thomas M. Watson, Sr. as a Presidential candidate on the Democratic ticket. Mr. Watson was the founder of the International Business Machines Company. Mr. Watson told this author at that time that he believed General Eisenhower as a civilian would make a great president. As President of the United States, General Eisenhower was faithful to [the] Talmudist Jew supporters whose friendship he first cultivated in Europe during his political activities in Germany after the end of World War II.... Talmudist Jews knew that as President of the United States, General Eisenhower in their hands would be like clay in the hands of the potter. In 1956 it appeared that the Middle East countries were undergoing changes in their governments. The Zionist illegal occupation of Palestine still existed. Populations in Middle East countries were growing restless. Talmudist Jews recognized that something must be done to silence the unrest. President Eisenhower obliged.... Lebanon is the heart of Middle East political activity. To nip action in the bud, by native populations aiming to assert their independence from domination by Talmudist Jews, Talmudist Jews arranged with President Eisenhower to occupy Lebanon with 14,000 troops and to station the Sixth Fleet off the coast. To make it legal Talmudist Jews had Congress pass a Joint Resolution like the Tonkin Bay Resolution passed by Congress to legalize the war in Viet Nam. Present Eisenhower... satisfied Talmudist Jews in the United States at the expense of United States taxpayers. President Eisenhower was warning the Middle East nations not to attempt to regain Palestine from the Zionists.... President Eisenhower... had a consortium of the smartest Talmudist Jews in the State, Defense, and Justice Departments prepare that Joint Resolution. The intent of [its] unclear language is to conceal the purpose of the Joint Resolution, not to explain its purpose. The purpose was to have a Joint Resolution on record that would permit President Eisenhower to use the United States armed forces and navy to aid and abet the Zionist thieves to hold onto their stolen loot without any necessity to ask Congress to declare war. <br />
<br />
Every word President Eisenhower uttered to defend the crooks in occupation of Palestine was a lie which contributed to the desperate predicament in which the United States today finds itself.... Talmudist Jews in the United States were able to camouflage their illegal aggression in the Middle East behind the glamour of President Eisenhower's record as a great soldier. The story of how President John F. Kennedy lied the United States into the desperate predicament in which the United States today finds itself in the Middle East is very distressing. President Kennedy's future was uncertain after digressing on August 25, 1960, from the straight and narrow path he had followed all his life. President Kennedy could not escape the consequences of his betrayal of the high principles to which he aimed to dedicate his life. President Kennedy surrendered to the lure of Talmudist Jews who pledged to put him in the White House as the President of the United States. On August 23, 1960, in the United States Senate Office Building in Washington, President Kennedy, at that time a Senator, gave this author a copy of the address he was to deliver in New York City on August 25, 1960. In the copy of that address which he gave this author... President Kennedy stated among other things: &quot;Israel is here to stay...[Israel] will endure and flourish [and there is] a special obligation on the Democratic Party.... It was President Truman who first recognized the new State of Israel and gave it status in world affairs.... [It is] my hope and my pledge to continue this Democratic tradition.... if the Democratic platform is to have any meaning the White House must take the lead.... American intervention... will not now be easy... I propose that we make it crystal clear... we will act promptly and decisively.... ...our guarantee [is that] we will act with whatever force and speed are necessary....&quot; Senator Kennedy was giving Talmudist Jews his pledge that as the President of the United States he would send sons, husbands, and brothers of the grass roots population of the United States to fight in Palestine... to aid and abet thieves retain possession of their stolen plunder. This author met President Kennedy for the first time in his father's office at 230 Park Avenue, in New York City, on the day after he was elected for the first time as a Congressman in November 1946. This author was in a conference with Ambassador Joseph Kennedy and Judge Landis, an associate of Ambassador Kennedy. In his private office they were consulting this author on the Middle East situation which had recently taken an ugly turn in the United Nations. Suddenly the door to the private office flew open and in came the new Congressman. Congressman Kennedy was on his way from Boston to Washington and burst into his father's office bubbling with enthusiasm. Ambassador Kennedy introduced this author to the new Congressman and advised his son that he would do well to keep in touch with this author as a source of information he would need soon on the Palestine question. Ambassador Kennedy discussed the subject matter for a short while with those present. The Congressman then asked to leave as he was catching a train for Washington. This author invited the Congressman to lunch and he accepted. After lunch Congressman Kennedy asked if this author had nothing else to do than ride to Washington with him on the train. This author was willing and rode to Washington with him. From that day in November 1946 to August 23, 1960, this author saw the Congressman, and [later] Senator, countless times at his office in Washington and New York City. This author was happy to enlighten Senator Kennedy on the Palestine question. Without a doubt there were soon few people in the world who were better informed on this subject than Senator Kennedy. <br />
<br />
In the fourteen years this author had the honor of enjoying the confidence of President Kennedy he never failed to express his appreciation for this author's interest in his career. President Kennedy also appreciated the friendship this author demonstrated for his father, Ambassador Kennedy. Ambassador Kennedy was blackmailed by President Roosevelt. President Roosevelt told Ambassador Kennedy not to write the book Ambassador Kennedy planned to write. President Roosevelt removed Ambassador Kennedy as Ambassador to the Court of St. James in London for circulating what Neville Chamberlain told Ambassador Kennedy in London in 1938. ...Neville Chamberlain told him that the United States and Talmudist Jews throughout the world [were forcing] Great Britain into... war. Chamberlain also told Ambassador Kennedy in 1938 that Great Britain had nothing with which to fight Germany, [and] that Great Britain should not risk going to war against Germany.... President Roosevelt recalled Ambassador Kennedy to silence him. Ambassador Kennedy planned... to write a book telling what he knew.... President Roosevelt sent for Ambassador Kennedy upon his return to the United States.... [He] told... Kennedy he had heard Ambassador Kennedy was planning to write a book which he asked him not to do. After Ambassador Kennedy's unpleasant meeting with President Roosevelt in Washington, after his recall from London for daring to circulate what Chamberlain had told him about Talmudist Jews, Ambassador Kennedy's ambition in life was to see one of his sons in the White House as President of the United States. The story of how President Lyndon Baines Johnson lied the United States in the desperate predicament in which the United States today finds itself in the Middle East is not a long story. It commences with a telephone call to this author in New York from Congressman Ed Gosset in Washington to come there at once. Congressman Gosset represented Amarillo, Texas in the House of Representatives. Congressman Gosset was alarmed that the Senate Armed Services Committee the day before confirmed the appointment of Anna M. Rosenberg as Assistant Secretary of Defense without a public hearing.... Congressman Gosset took this author to Senator Johnson's office and explained to him the reason for the visit. Senator Johnson was a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.... Senator Johnson was very much interested in learning about Anna Rosenberg's associations with communists. Senator Johnson asked this author if he would assist him in looking into the matter further by producing a communist who knew Anna Rosenberg. Upon this author's return to New York that day, he mentioned Senator Johnson's request to his attorney, Mr. Hallam Richardson. Within a few hours, Mr. Richardson produced Mr. Ralph de Sola, a prominent Communist, the head of film photography of documents by communist organizations in the United States. ...In this author's meetings with Senator Johnson, this author had the occasion to discuss the Palestine question with him. Senator Johnson was very interested in the Palestine question. That subject was of great interest to the Senate Armed Services Committee.... As President of the United States, President Johnson was aware of the possibility of armed conflict in the Middle East in which the United States might become involved. President Johnson understood the power Talmudist Jews exerted in the United States and in the United Nations. One of his closest friends in Washington was Mr. Abe Fortas, a prominent Zionist, whom President Johnson appointed to the Supreme Court. President Johnson knew he was violating the letter and spirit of his oath of office as the President of all the people of the United States when he filled the pipelines of the State of Israel with munitions of war paid for with the money of ...taxpayers in the United States. President Johnson cannot plead ignorance of the facts. Through a very close mutual friend, this author kept President Johnson constantly informed on developments in the Middle East. ...President Johnson now seeks to justify his generosity with United States taxpayers' money by referring to a commitment. President Johnson knows that he is in error. The only commitment the taxpayers in the United States recognize is President Johnson's commitment to serve the best interests of the grass roots population of the United States. President Nixon is as guilty as the other six masters of deception who lied the United States into the desperate predicament in which the United States today finds itself in the Middle East. President Nixon is both an eminent lawyer and President of the United States. President Nixon cannot produce any evidence of a legitimate commitment to anyone to support President Nixon's generous use of United States taxpayers' money for financing the permanent possession by thieves of their stolen loot. Does President Nixon mean the commitment by political leaders to the Talmudist Jews in the United States who control the media for mass information? <br />
<br />
President Nixon belittles himself as well as the United States ********************istration for whom he speaks when he talks about a commitment of the United States to underwrite the perpetual possession of the illegal and immoral theft of Palestine by Talmudist Jews. President Nixon's generosity has reached epidemic proportions. Each of the additional five hundred million dollars of United States taxpayers' money President Nixon donates to the so-called State of Israel are that many more nails in the coffin of the United States. These seven masters of deception mock the elementary and equitable principles upon which the United States was founded when they throw hard-earned United States taxpayers' dollars by the billions to criminals in possession of their stolen loot as if it were stage money. Have they no shame or conscience? This author has had the patience and the time to inform seven Presidents of the United States about the underlying reason for Middle East aggression by the Talmudist Jews throughout the world. These seven masters of deception were all briefed by this author on the reason for the aggression in Palestine. This author spent a small fortune acquainting members of Congress and political and industrial leaders in the United States with all these facts, supplying them with photostat reproductions of documentary evidence to support every statement made by this author. If the Talmudist Jews of the world say they are willing to see another world war fought to establish God's chosen people in their promised land to rule the world from Palestine, then it is time to tell the grass roots of the United States population what all the excitement is about. This issue must be dragged into the light for the grass roots of the population of the United States to see why they are expected to die in a nuclear war with a smile on their face. The time is growing late.... This author pleads with readers of this manu************************ to purchase as many copies as their means will permit, to be circulated by them where they believe this information is needed and necessary. Sacrifice some little luxury, or even a necessity to purchase as many copies as possible. The truth contained in this manu************************ can save America and the world. Let the readers resolve to put [this information] in the hands of every knowledgeable person of his acquaintance. You have been listening to Jewish author Benjamin Freedman's manu************************ The Hidden Tyranny, an expose of the covert power behind the facade of seven Presidents and ********************istrations in this country. On the last program, I mentioned the fact that Mr. Freedman constantly refers to members of the Jewish establishment as Talmudist Jews. He is undoubtedly drawing a distinction between those Jews like himself who reject the teachings of the Jewish holy book, the Talmud, and those who accept such teachings. I have only a few minutes left on the program today, so I haven't time for a full treatment of the subject which will have to wait for a future program, but Mr. Freedman explains himself fully on the matter in his 1954 book, Facts Are Facts. In essence, this second blockbuster by Mr. Freedman exposes the repugnant and anti-Gentile passages in this supposed holy book, the reverence of which is probably both a consequence and a cause of the aggressive mentality of organized Jewry. I will quote a few passages in a moment and some of them are shocking. Children and sensitive adults should turn off their radios now. <br />
<br />
What is the Talmud? According to Rabbi Morris M. Kertzner &quot;The Talmud consists of 63 books of legal, ethical, and historical writings of the ancient rabbis. ...It is a compendium of law and lore. It is the legal code which forms the basis of Jewish religious law and it is the textbook used in the training of rabbis.&quot; The Talmud contains sanction of shocking sexual perversions. In Kethuboth 11a to 11b, the Talmud says: When a grown up man has intercourse with a little girl, it is nothing, for when the girl is less than this [less than three years old] it is as if one puts the finger in the eye [tears come to the eyes again and again, so does virginity come back to the little girl under three years...] [Note: Items in brackets in Talmud extracts are notes in the original text. -- Ed.] In the book Yebamoth 60b, the Talmud states:<br />
<br />
There was a certain town in the land of Israel, the legitimacy of whose inhabitants was disputed, and Rabbi sent Rabbi Ramanos who conducted an enquiry and found in it the daughter of a proselyte who was under the age of three years and one day, and Rabbi declared her eligible to live with a priest, [and was married to a priest.] That is one of many perverted passages. More than anything else, the shocking thing about the Talmud is its teaching of hatred toward all non-Jews. One passage even calls for the death of any Gentile who would read it or reveal its secrets. Benjamin Freedman's Facts Are Facts lists well over 100 anti-Gentile and anti-Christian passages in the Talmud, including accusations that non-Jews have sexual relations with animals; that only Jews are truly men while all other peoples are beasts in human form; that it is permitted to lie to us or kill us with impunity; that we exist only to serve the Chosen People; that our birth rate must be reduced materially; that we may not be saved by a Jew even if we are in danger of death; and that even the best among us should be killed. The Talmud is truly of work of hatred. Strange indeed that it should come from a people whose leadership likes to pose as opponents of hatred as defined by them. Not so strange that Benjamin Freedman used the term Talmudist Jews to distinguish such persons from those Jews, like himself, who rejected the creed of the Talmud, from which poisoned soil grew Communism and Zionism.
