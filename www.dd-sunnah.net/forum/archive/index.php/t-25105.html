<br />
<br />
1)Mahdi of the Rafdhis will rule according to the Laws of David and the family of David: <br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Al-Kulyani reports in his work al-Kafi, volume no.1, p.397-398: <br />
a)Narrated Ali ibn Ibraheem -from his father-from ibn Abi Umair-from Mansour-from Fadhl al Aour-from Abi Ubaidah who reported: ìDuring the times of Imam Jaffar[as] we used to go around like herds without a caretaker. We met with Salim ibn Abi Hafs who asked me: îOh Abu Ubaidullah, who is your Imam?î I replied:î My Imams are from the household of the prophetî. He then stated: ìYou have perished and so have I for both of us have heared Abu Jafar[as] saying: ìOne who dies without recognizing his Imam, he dies a death of Jahiliyyah.î Then I affirmed what he said. It was before that three or somewhat close to it(time span) when I entered upon Abu Abdullah[as] and God granted me knowledge. Then I said to Abu Abdullah[as]: ìSalim said such and such.î He replied: ìOh Abu Obaidah nobody here will die until he is succeeded by some one who does the same thing as his, and adopts the similar manners of his predecessor, and calls to the same thing as his predecessor did. Oh Abu Ubaidah, it was permitted that whatever was given to David was also provided for Sulaiman.î Then he added: ìOh Abu Ubaidah when the Qaem of the household of the prophet appears, he will rule according to rule of David and Solomon.î <br />
<br />
b)Muhammad ibn Yahya-Ahmad ibn Muhammad-Muhammad ibn Sinaan-Abaan who reported: ìI heard Abu Abdullah[as] saying: ìThe world will not fade away unless a person from us appears who will rule according to the rule of the family of David and he will not ask his house. He will give every one his right. <br />
<br />
c)Ahmad--Ahmad ibn Muhammad--Ibn Mahboob--Hisham ibn Salim--Ammar as Saabati who reported: ìI asked Abu Abdullah[as] : ìOn what will you rule if you are made the rulers.î He replied: ìBy the rule of Allah and the rule of David. And if we are confronted by a situation which we cannot solve, Gabriel( Ruh al Quds) will reveal it to us.î <br />
<br />
d)Muhammad ibn Ahmad--Muhammad ibn Khalid--Nazr ibn Suwaid--Yahya al Halabi--Imran ibn Oueiyn--Jaeed al Hamdani--Ali ibn al-Hussein[as] said: ìI asked him by which law will you rule?î He said: ìBy the rule of David, and if there is something which we are unaware of, Gabriel(Ruh al Quds) will reveal it to us.î <br />
e)Ahmad ibn Mahran[ra]--Muhammad ibn Ali--Ibn Mahboob--Hishaam bin Salim--Ammar as Saabati reported: I asked Imam Abu Abdullah[as] :ìWhat is the status of the Aimmah.î He replied : ìIt is similar to the status of Dhul Qarnain, Ushegh, and Asef the companion of prophet Sulaiman.î Then I asked: ìBy what will you rule?î He replied: ìBy the rule of God, by the rule of David, and by the rule of the Prophet Muhammad[saw] and by the revealation of Gabriel. <br />
<br />
2)Mahdi Al-Muntazar will speak in Hebrew: <br />
<br />
<br />
Reported to us Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Saeed al Uqdah who said: Narrated to us Ali ibn al-Hasan at-Taymali who said: narrated to us al-Hasan and Muhammad the sons of Ali ibnu Yusuf, from Saídaan ibnu Muslim, from rajaal, from alMufadhaal ibn Umar who said: <br />
Abu Abdullah[as] reported: ìWhen the Imam Mahdi calls out, he will supplicate to God in Hebrew.î[ Shiite source: Al-Ghaybaa of an Numani, p.326] <br />
<br />
3)The Jews will be the followers of Imam Mahdi: <br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Sheikh alMufeed has reported in his Al-Irshaad from alMufadhaal ibnu Umar that Imam Abu Abdullah[as] has reported: ìThere will appear along with Imam Mahdi in Kufa, 27 people from the tribe of Moses, and seven from the people of the cave, and Yushegh ibn Nun, and Sulaiman, and Abu Dujjana al-Ansari, and Miqdad, and Malik Usthur who all be his(imam Mahdiís helpers).î[ Al-Irshaad of al-mufeed at Tusi p.402] <br />
<br />
And with this we summarize that the Mahdi of the Shiites: <br />
<br />
---Will rule according to the system of the family of David, and by a new Quran that is unavailable in our hands. And if someone asks where is the Laws of David, he will find the answer to be the Talmud without any doubt. And for this reason the Mahdi of the Rafidhis will take an oath on a new book as it is stated by an-Nuímani in his work al-Ghayba, p.107: ìAbu Jafar[as] said: ì By God, as if I am seeing him between the Rukn and Maqaam taking an oath of allegiance with a new order, with a new book, and a new leadership from the heavens.î <br />
<br />
---His language will be Hebrew <br />
<br />
---His followers will be of the Jews, for he is the king of the Jews and he himself is the Dajjal or the Jewish Anti Christ about whom the Prophet has described. <br />
<br />
<br />
More strong Proofs that show Mahdi of the Shiites is the Jewish Dajjal: <br />
<br />
---When the Dajjal appears the Diaspora of the Jews will flock and gather in Jewish holy city of Jerusalem. Similarly when the Mahdi of the Shiites appear , all the Shiites any where will flock to him and gather in the Shiite holy city of Kufa. <br />
<br />
---When the Dajjal appears the dead Jews will be resurrected from their graves by him and they would join the ranks of the Dajjal. Similarly when the Mahdi of the Rafidhis appears he will resurrect the dead of the Shiites and they would join his ranks. <br />
<br />
---When the Dajjal appears he will resurrect the enemies of the Jews and will punish them. When the Mahdi of the Shiites appear he will resurrect the prophetís companions and will punish them. <br />
<br />
---The Dajjal will place on trial every one who oppressed the Jews. The Mahdi of the Shiites will place on trial every one who oppressed the Shiites. <br />
<br />
---The Dajjal will kill 1/3 of the world population. Likewise the Mahdi of the Shiites will kill 1/3 of the world population. <br />
<br />
---During the time of the Jewish Dajjal the earth will be filled with bounties for the Jews, the mountains will turn into milk and honey for the Jews. When the Mahdi of the Rafidhis appear a river of milk and a river of water will burst for the Shiites. <br />
<br />
And the points that prove the association of Mahdi with the Jews is: <br />
a)When the Mahdi appears he will call out to God in Hebrew. <br />
b)He will rule by the system of the family of David. <br />
<br />
Here are the evidences: <br />
<br />
---It has been reported in Bihaarul Anwar that one of the Muwali of Abul Hassan[as] stated: I asked Abul Hassan about the verse : ìAyna ma takunu Yaíti bikumullahu Jameeíaanî. He said: ìThis is verse is pointing out to our Qaem when he appears, God will gather our Shiites from different corners of the world.î <br />
<br />
---Al-Amaali has reported from Abu Abdullah[as] that he was asked for how long will the Qaem rule? He replied : ìSeven years who days will be stretched.....during this period God will raise the flesh and bodies of the believers(Shiites) from the graves.î almufadhaal ibnu Umar has reported: ìwe were discussing about Qaem, and whoever dies he is awaited by our fellows. Abu Abdullah[as] has said to us: ìWhen he (Qaem) appears a believer will be approached in his grave and will be told: oh so and so, your fellow (the Qaem) has appeared, if you wish to join his ranks then do so, and if you wish you can remain in the mercy of your lord(in other words you can remain in your grave).î <br />
<br />
---Al-Majlisi has reported from Abu Abdullah[as] who stated: ìdo you know with whom will the Qaem start with?î the answer was negative. Then he replied: ìHe will dig out the two culprits(Abu Bakr and Umar) burn their bodies and then let the wind to blow their ashes. <br />
<br />
---Al-Mufeed reports from Abu Abdullah[as] that he said: ìWhen the Qaem of the household of the Prophet appears he will grab hold of 500 members of the Quraish and will chop their necks off. He will do the same procedure with another 500. this action will be repeated 7 times. <br />
<br />
---al-Majlisi has stated a narration reported from Jaffar ibn Muhammad who reported from his father who heard from his grandfather that : ìwhen the Mahdi appears in Makkah and intends to go to Kufa, an announcer will call out: ìThat none of you should carry with himself food or drink and should carry only the stone of Moses...when they place the front side of the stone on the ground, it will let go an ever flowing river of milk and water, which will quench the thirst and hunger. <br />
<br />
---Al-Ihsaaii has reported that Abu Abdullah[as] said : ìThe matter will not happen(victory of Qaem) until a third of the people are gone.î He was asked: ìwhen a third of humanity is gone then what will be left?î Abu Abdullah[as] answered: ìArent you pleased that the remainder are you?î <br />
<br />
Authentic Ahadith of the Prophet about the Dajjal <br />
<br />
---The Prophet(saw) said that the Dajjal will descend in Marqand .......then Allah will grant the Muslims victory on him who will kill him and his SHIA in so much that when the Jew hides behind a tree or a stone, then the tree and the stone will say to the Muslim that there is a Jew behind me come and kill him,(Musnad Imam Ahmad #5099) <br />
<br />
the question arises here: Why didnt the prophet not say ìItibíaaî or followers instead of ìSHIAî or partisans? they were actually called rawafids in the past but now they are called Shiites, and the Prophet doesnt speak of his own! <br />
<br />
---the Prophet(saw) has stated : ìThe Dajjal will be followed by 70,000 Jews of Isfahan, having on themselves persian shawls.î[Sahih Muslim #5227] <br />
Question: What makes the Dajjal to go to Isfahan as it is a Shiite land and why is the involvement of the Jews in a Shiite city? Is this a coincidence? <br />
<br />
We all know the that the Shiites say that may God hasten the coming of their locked Qaem and we all know that the one who is locked and made hidden is the Dajjal as reported in the narration of Tamim ad-Darri in Sahih Bukhari,so there is no place for the Shiites to err, oops I mean to show taqiyya! lol</div></div><hr />
