Shaykh al-Albaanee Debates a Supporter of Celebrating the Mawlid - <br />
<br />
This is an audio translation of a discussion that took place when a follower of Muhammad al-'Alawee came to debate the Muhaddith of our time about the permissibility of celebrating the Prophet's (sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam) Birthday. As was the norm during the life of Shaykh Muhammad Naasirud-Deen al-Albaanee (d.1420H), people from various sects and group would often come to debate him and leave defeated, or convinced of the correctness of his 'aqeedah and manhaj. So SunnahPublishing.net presents this Arabic-to-English audio recording in hopes of convincing those who have doubts about the unlawfulness and innovation of celebrating the Mawlid that this is an unlawful and innovated celebration - having no connection to the Religion of Islam whatsoever. <br />
<br />
NOTE: At [37:26] Shaykh al-Albaanee quotes the famous hadeeth: From 'Abdullaah Ibn Mas'ood (radiyallaahu 'anhu), from the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam) who said, &quot;The best of people are my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them.&quot; Related by al-Bukhaaree (no. 2652) and Muslim (no. 2533). However, the Shaykh quotes it with the wording, &quot;khayrul-quroon&quot; (the best of generations), instead of, &quot;khayrun-naas&quot; (the best of people). Shaykh al-Albaanee himself has mentioned in his notes upon at-Tankeel (2/223), &quot;This is the wording that has become famous upon the tongues...&quot; <br />
<br />
Then he goes onto to clarify that though this wording has been mentioned repeatedly in the books of Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H), such as his book al-Furqaan (p. 100), and by his student Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (d.751H) and other Scholars, it is not confirmed by the books of Sunnah. Rather, it is only a narration of the meaning. <br />

<br />
The Reality of Sufism by Abu Khadeejah as Salafi<br />
Sufism: a sect that has introduced many innovated practices and beliefs into the religion of Islam while claiming to be mystical<br />
<br />
Sufism was not known in the time of the Prophet (may Allah raise his rank and grant him peace) or his Companions, nor was it well known in the first three generations after them. It first appeared in Basrah in Iraq, where some people went to extremes in worship and in avoiding the worldly life, something which is admonished in the Quran:<br />
<br />
&quot;The Monasticism which they invented for themselves; We did not prescribe it for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sufis belong to the Illumist school of philosophy which holds that knowledge and awareness is brought about in the soul by spiritual exercises. Orthodox Islam holds that one can achieve true knowledge and awareness through the acts of worship that exist in the Quran and Sunnah.<br />
<br />
Sufis believe that their teachers are also a source for legislation in worship, as they will order them to carry out acts of worship that have no basis in either the Quran or the Sunnah. The extremists from amongst them often claim that Allah dwells within His creation (i.e. in people's hearts, internal organs etc.). Consequently, they ascribe to their Sufi teachers attributes and powers which only belong to Allah, such as the knowledge of the unseen.<br />
<br />
They often claim that the texts of the Quran and the Sunnah have an outer, apparent meaning, and as well, an inner, hidden meaning. They hold that the outer, apparent meaning is known to those who practice orthodox Islam, while the inner and hidden meanings of the Quran and Sunnah are known only to their teacher and order. These teachers will often claim that since they have advanced to the inner and hidden meaning of Islam, they no longer need to pray or fast, something that not even the Prophets were excused from.<br />

SUFI Naqshabandi Tariqah Unveiled<br />
<br />
A comparison of the Paganistic Naqshabandite Creed and the Monotheistic creed of the mainstream Ahl us-Sunnah (orthodox Muslims).<br />

It is compulsory on the `Ulamaa to make an effort to inform the public through all means available about the group's deviant nature. Articles exposing the group should be written and distributed. Many Muslims have passively sat by for a long time, believing that the group would soon fizzle out and disappear. Instead, its cancerous growth has continued unabated and unchecked. As for those who in spite of what they have read, continue to have misgivings about exposing the group due to their desire to maintain an image of unity with respect to Islaam, then let them reflect on the following incident, &quot;When some people mentioned to Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (rahimahullaah) that they felt uneasy about criticizing people (who had deviated in their beliefs), he replied - &quot;If I were to remain silent, how then would the masses know truth from falsehood?&quot; (Reported by Imaam Ibn Taymeeyah in Majmoo`ah ar-Rasaail wa al-Masaail, vol 4, Page 10, Arabic). According to the unanimous agreement of Muslim scholars, those who introduce deviant writings and religious rites, contrary to the Quraan and Sunnah have to be exposed and the Muslm nation warned against them. In fact, when Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (rahimahullaah) was asked if one who fasted, prayed and secluded himself in the Masjid was dearer to him than one who spoke out against people involved in deviations, he replied, when one fasts, prays and secludes oneself, he does so for himself alone; but if he speaks out against deviations, he does so for Muslims in general, which is more noble.<br />
<br />
It is your duty and responsibility to Allaah, to warn your brothers and sisters, then please do not be a silent spectator, spread the truth to the best of your ability. Perhaps you may save a soul or two from the deviant clutches of the group.<br />

Deviations of the Ashari Sufis Hamza Yusuf, Habib Ali Jifri, Nuh-Ha-Meem Keller et al<br />

<br />
The famous Qasida Burda by Busiri that Hamza Yusuf and other sufis chant states within it:<br />
<br />
OH MOST GENEROUS OF MANKIND (referring to the Prophet sallah Allaahu alayhi wasalam) I HAVE NO ONE TO SEEK REFUGE IN EXCEPT YOU WHEN THE WIDESPREAD CALAMITY OCCURS.<br />
<br />
Did he forget that he can seek refuge in Allaah the ALL HEARER? Allaah the MOST HIGH says:<br />
<br />
(Qur'an 113:1) Say: &quot;I seek refuge with (All‚h) the Lord of the daybreak<br />
<br />
(Quran 114:1) Say: &quot;I seek refuge with (All‚h) the Lord of mankind,<br />
<br />
Did he forget that the dead can't hear the living?<br />
<br />
[Qur'an 27:080] Verily, you cannot make the dead to hear (i.e. benefit them and similarly the disbelievers), nor can you make the deaf to hear the call, when they flee, turning their backs.<br />
<br />
[Qur'an 46:005] And who is more astray than one who calls (invokes) besides Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls (invocations) to them?<br />
<br />
He is a clear deviant misguiding many so why do you love him? Is it because his English impresses you? Isn't the correct belief the most important thing or is speaking articulately more important? WAKE UP OH MUSLIMS<br />
<br />
Allaah says:&quot;And invoke not besides All‚h, any that will neither profit you, nor hurt you, but if (in case) you did so, you shall certainly be one of the Z‚lim˚n (polytheists and wrong-doers).<br />
<br />
The burdah also says: &quot;I swear by the moon that split.&quot;<br />
<br />
However, it is not permissible to swear by other than Allaah the MOST HIGH, and to do so is a minor form of Shirk. The Prophet (sallah Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: Whomever gives an oath by other than Allaah has committed Shirk or kufr. (Ahmed, 4509 &amp; Tirmidhee, 1534)<br />
<br />
The Burdah also states within it:<br />
<br />
&quot; and how could you give the dunya importance, when if it was not for him (the prophet), the dunya would not have appeared from nothingness &quot;<br />
<br />
This is more deviation. Allaah the MOST HIGH says:<br />
<br />
&quot;And I did not create the Jinn and the Mankind except to worship me&quot; (Surah al-Dhariyat, 56)<br />
<br />
The Burdah states: Discard what the Christians claim about their Nabi Then decide and say what you wish in praise of him (Rasulullah Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam). (Chapter 3/29-30)<br />
<br />
The proof against this is the Prophet (sallah allahu alieh wasalam) said, &quot;Do not do to me as the Christians did to Jesus, I am a messenger of Allah, therefore, say the servant of Allah and His messenger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ibn Al Jawzy said the hadith means do not go into extreme in one's love for the Prophet (sallah allahu alieh wasalam). The context of the hadith was such that Mu'ath (radia allahu anh) asked the Prophet if he may prostrate to him, and the Prophet (sallah allah alieh wasalam) set a rule against going into extreme love for him.<br />
<br />
Dr Saleh as-Saleh Raheemahulah stated regarding the Burdah:<br />
<br />
A special warning concerning the infamous Burdah poem of Al-Busiri: It is plain shirk because it exaggerates the Prophet (&#61554;) giving him attributes of divinity, as if he knows the unseen and what is written in the preserved tablet. So much of this, unfortunately, is spread throughout the Muslim world and particularly in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia. Think about it. Moreover, they have musical groups in these countries only specialized to sing these poems, especially the &quot;Burdah&quot;. In some recent forms, it is &quot;recited by Khalid Belrhouzi featuring Yusuf Islam (yes!) This is an ad on the net carrying the title:<br />
<br />
Burdah (audio tape) Khalid Belrhouzi and Yusuf Islam (Arabic + English)<br />
<br />
It is stated in this poem, among other things, that And of your knowledge is the knowledge of the pen and the preserved tablet! The &quot;pen refers to the pen which Allah commanded it saying: &quot;Write! It said, 'What should I write, my Rabb (Lord)? Allah said: Write the record of all preordained matter until the commencement of the Hour.&quot;9 According to this poet, the Prophet knows what the pen already wrote and what is written in the preserved tablet. We seek refuge in Allah from these fabrications.<br />
End of quote<br />
<br />
Regarding the knowledge of the unseen then Allaah the Most-High says:<br />
<br />
And with Him are the keys of the Ghaib (all that is hidden), none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in (or on) the earth and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but he knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record. (Qur'an 6:59)<br />

Q.30:52 &quot;..Verily you cannot make the dead hear..&quot; (1/2) Dr. Saleh as-Saleh<br />
<br />
Read why 'Aaisha (RadiyaAllaahu 'Anha) used this verse:<br />

<br />
§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§<br />
(It is only those who listen will respond, but as for the dead, Allah will raise them up, then to Him they will be returned.) (6:36) `A'ishah, the Mother of the faithful, may Allah be pleased with her, used this Ayah --<br />
<br />
[&#1573;&#1616;&#1606;&#1614;&#1617;&#1603;&#1614; &#1604;&#1575;&#1614; &#1578;&#1615;&#1587;&#1618;&#1605;&#1616;&#1593;&#1615; &#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1605;&#1614;&#1608;&#1618;&#1578;&#1614;&#1609;]<br />
<br />
(So verily, you cannot make the dead to hear) as evidence against `Abdullah bin `Umar when he reported that the Prophet had addressed the slain disbelievers who had been thrown into a dry well three days after the battle of Badr, rebuking and reprimanding them, until `Umar said, &quot;O Messenger of Allah, are you addressing people who are dead bodies'' He said:<br />
<br />
´&#1608;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1614;&#1617;&#1584;&#1616;&#1610; &#1606;&#1614;&#1601;&#1618;&#1587;&#1616;&#1610; &#1576;&#1616;&#1610;&#1614;&#1583;&#1616;&#1607;&#1616; &#1605;&#1614;&#1575; &#1571;&#1614;&#1606;&#1618;&#1578;&#1615;&#1605;&#1618; &#1576;&#1616;&#1571;&#1614;&#1587;&#1618;&#1605;&#1614;&#1593;&#1614; &#1604;&#1616;&#1605;&#1614;&#1575; &#1571;&#1614;&#1602;&#1615;&#1608;&#1604;&#1615; &#1605;&#1616;&#1606;&#1618;&#1607;&#1615;&#1605;&#1618;&#1548; &#1608;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1603;&#1616;&#1606;&#1618; &#1604;&#1614;&#1575; &#1610;&#1615;&#1580;&#1616;&#1610;&#1576;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;ª<br />
<br />
(By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, you do not hear what I say any better than they do, but they cannot respond.) s`A'ishah interpreted this event to mean that the Prophet was making the point that now they would know that what he had been telling them was true. Qatadah said: &quot;Allah brought them back to life for him so that they could hear what he said by way of rebuke and vengeance.''<br />
<br />
[&#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1614;&#1617;&#1607;&#1615; &#1575;&#1604;&#1614;&#1617;&#1584;&#1616;&#1609; &#1582;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1602;&#1614;&#1603;&#1615;&#1605;&#1618; &#1605;&#1616;&#1617;&#1606; &#1590;&#1614;&#1593;&#1618;&#1601;&#1613; &#1579;&#1615;&#1605;&#1614;&#1617; &#1580;&#1614;&#1593;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614; &#1605;&#1616;&#1606; &#1576;&#1614;&#1593;&#1618;&#1583;&#1616; &#1590;&#1614;&#1593;&#1618;&#1601;&#1613; &#1602;&#1615;&#1608;&#1614;&#1617;&#1577;&#1613; &#1579;&#1615;&#1605;&#1614;&#1617; &#1580;&#1614;&#1593;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614; &#1605;&#1616;&#1606; &#1576;&#1614;&#1593;&#1618;&#1583;&#1616; &#1602;&#1615;&#1608;&#1614;&#1617;&#1577;&#1613; &#1590;&#1614;&#1593;&#1618;&#1601;&#1575;&#1611; &#1608;&#1614;&#1588;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1576;&#1614;&#1577;&#1611; &#1610;&#1614;&#1582;&#1618;&#1604;&#1615;&#1602;&#1615; &#1605;&#1614;&#1575; &#1610;&#1614;&#1588;&#1614;&#1570;&#1569;&#1615; &#1608;&#1614;&#1607;&#1615;&#1608;&#1614; &#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1593;&#1614;&#1604;&#1616;&#1610;&#1605;&#1615; &#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1602;&#1614;&#1583;&#1616;&#1610;&#1585;&#1615; ]<br />

SHIRK IN THE NAQSHBANDI TAREEQAH<br />
source: Alwalaa'wa'lbaraaYesterday I was invited to visit the Naqshbandi homepage, because itís great, I was told. This caused me to take one of their articles and demonstrate once again the greatest Shirk that we can find in their writings. <br />
The article, &quot;Meded - Asking Support From Grandsheikh&quot;, which I include below, contains several jaahilee concepts, among which:<br />
Du`aa to Allah to derive from the Grandsheikh (Ad-Daghistani) from his spiritual care even from the grave. <br />
&quot;We derive our spiritual power from his heart center.&quot; <br />
&quot;Öthe breaths of Allahís Saints give life to their followers, to their spiritual sons and daughters.&quot; <br />
&quot;Öa real Grandsheikh always keeps a watchful eye on his followers&quot; [even if passed away] <br />
Claim that to stand firmly in the face of our enemies: the lower self, Shaytaan, vain desires and worldliness, &quot;we need his support,&quot; and that &quot;without such a strong support a person will be vanquished.&quot; <br />
Their saying, &quot;Therefore, we seek our Grandsheikhís support by saying: &quot;Meded Ya Sayyidi&quot;, &quot;Support, oh my Master.&quot; &quot;You must call upon your Grandsheikh in such a manner when you are in need of support, then that support may reach you.&quot; <br />
Their claim that guidance reaches to our hearts through the Saints. <br />
Their saying, &quot;you must look for the support of the Saints in a Universe in which you are totally weak.&quot;<br />
This article is useful for explaining how some people fall in shirk in all aspects of Tauheed: <br />
Shirk in Tauheed ur-Ruboobeeyah:<br />
Their claim that the Grandsheikh can bring good fortune or remove calamities; he can govern the affairs of this world and he is believed to have power and influence besides Allaah, or that Allaah creates creations that can cause harm and benefit to His creatures. The Grandsheikh is one upon whom we are dependent for guidance and spiritual strength.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shirk in Tauheed ul-`Ibaadah:<br />
Directing oneís acts of worship, such as du`aa (supplication), seeking help, tawakkul (trust and reliance), and hope for good fortune to other than Allaah.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shirk in Tauheed ul-Asmaaíi was-Sifaat:<br />
Attributing divine power to Allaahís creation. Attributing to man the power to keep a watchful eye on his followers, whether alive or dead, the power and ability of guiding peopleís hearts that belongs to Allah alone, and ability to answer prayers of Allaahís creation and provide them with aid.<br />
Refutation from the Quríaan:<br />
<br />
Allaah says in the Quríaan, &quot;And who is more astray than one who calls besides Allaah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection; and who are (even) unaware of their calls to them? And when mankind gathered (on the Day of Resurrection), they (false deities) will become enemies for them and will deny their worshipping.&quot; (46:5-6) <br />
&quot;You Alone we worship and from You Alone we seek help.&quot; (1:5) <br />
&quot;Do they attribute to Allah those who created nothing but they themselves are created? No help can they give them, nor can they help themselves.&quot; (7:191-2) <br />
&quot;Those on whom you call besides Allaah are only slaves like yourselves.&quot; (7:194) <br />
&quot;Do not worship besides Allaah that which cannot help or harm you.&quot; (21:66) <br />
&quot;And those whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmir (the thin membrane over the date-stone). If you invoke them, they hear not your call, and if they were to hear, they could not grant it to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you like Him Who is the All-Knower.&quot; (35:13-14) <br />
&quot;And invoke not besides Allaah any that will neither profit you nor hurt you, but if (in case) you do so, you shall certainly be one of the Dhaalimooon. And if Allaah touches you with heart, there is none who can remove it but He; and if He intends any good for you, there is none who can repel His Favour which He causes it to reach whomsoever of His slaves He will. And He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&quot; (16:107) <br />
Also, &quot;You worship besides Allah only idols, and you only invent falsehood. Verily, those whom you worship besides Allaah have no power to give you provision, so seek your provision from Allaah (Alone) and worship Him (Alone), and be grateful to Him. To Him (Alone) you will be brought back.&quot; (29:17)<br />
Refutation from the Sunnah:<br />
<br />
&quot;If you ask in prayer ask only Allah, and if you seek help, seek it only from Allaah.&quot; [At-Tirmidhee, an-Nawawiís Forth Hadith] <br />
&quot;He who dies while praying to someone as rival to Allaah, the reward for such a person shall be the Fire of Hell.&quot; (Narrated by Al-Bukhaaree) <br />
&quot;O people of Quraish, sell your own souls. I will not be of any help to you before Allaah; O Abbaas ibn Abdul-Muttalib, I will not be of any help to you before Allaah; O Safiyah, aunt of Allaahís Messenger, I will not be of any help to you before Allaah; O Faatimah, daughter of Muhammad, ask of my wealth what you wish, I will be of no avail to you before Allaah.&quot; (Narrated by al-Bukhaaree) <br />
During the days of the Prophet, sallallaahu `alayhi wa sallam, there was a hypocrite who used to harm the believers, some of them (the believers) said: &quot;Come (support) with us while we appeal to Allaahís Messenger for assistance against this hypocrite.&quot; The Prophet, sallallaahu `alayhi wa sallam, replied, &quot;Verily, no one should seek to me for assistance. Indeed, it is Allaah Who is to be sought for assistance and help.&quot; (at-Tabaraanee)<br />
Saying of a scholar, Ibn Rajab, rahmatullaahi `alayhi:<br />
<br />
&quot;Know that it is an obligation to invoke Allah Alone in Du`aa, and not His creation. Invoking entails showing humiliation, destitution, need and poverty by the one <br />
who is invoking while admitting that the one who is being invoked has power over delivering such matters as removing hardship, delivering the need, bringing about benefit and fending off harm. Admitting (and showing) humility and meekness <br />
can only be revealed to Allaah, Alone, for this is the essence of worship.&quot; <br />
Proofs are numerous, since Shirk is crystal clear in their article, &quot;wa laa Hawla wa la quwwata illaa billaah&quot; (and there is no ability or power save by Allaah). <br />

Meded - Asking Support From Grandsheikh<br />
<br />
Our Grandsheikh is Sheikh Abdullah Al-Faiz Ad-Daghistani, may Allah Almighty sanctify his blessed soul and draw him ever closer to His Divine Presence. May He Almighty cause us to benefit from Grandsheikh's blessings and teachings, and from his spiritual care for us even from the grave. We derive our spiritual power from his heart center. If he cuts us off we are stranded. Every breath that our Grandsheikh turns toward us from his spiritual breaths is like a warm spring breeze which blows on the bare branches of trees, causing buds and blossoms to burst forth. <br />
Like the spring breeze that carries the revival of life within it, so do the breaths of Allah's Saints give life to their followers, to their spiritual sons and daughters. That relationship is stronger than the relationship to our parents, as there is only a short period of time in which they are all and everything to their small children, and, ultimately, it is very difficult for them to influence their children to follow the way of life that they would choose for them. Perhaps those children will leave them and go away to the far corners of the Earth and choose a way of life totally unrelated to that of their parents. But a real Grandsheikh always keeps a watchful eye on his followers, whether that Grandsheikh be living in this world or already has passed on to the existence beyond this world. He never abandons them. <br />
Yes, we are always seeking our Grandsheikh's support, support that will help us act according to our Lord's commands, and support to help us stand firmly in the face of our enemies: the lower self, Satan, vain desires and worldliness. For both of these goals - progress on the right way and avoiding deviation from it completely - we need his support. Without such a strong support a person will be vanquished. <br />
Therefore, we seek our Grandsheikh's support by saying: &quot;Meded Ya Sayyidi&quot;, &quot;Support, oh my Master.&quot; You must call upon your Grandsheikh in such a manner when you are in need of support, then that support may reach to you. The more you feel yourself to be weak and in need of support, the more support he will extend to you. But the more you depend on your own knowledge and your mind's powers, the less support you will receive, as Grandsheikh will say: &quot;He is self-sufficient, so why lend him support. Leave him in the hands of his ego.&quot; <br />
When the Holy Prophet asked his Lord, &quot;Oh my Lord, don't leave me in the hands of my ego even for a moment&quot;, he was seeking refuge from two undesirable possibilities: 1) to be left in the hands of his ego's base desires, and 2) to be left alone to guide himself only by his mind and knowledge. In both these ways the ego attempts to separate us from true guidance, and in admitting our weakness and seeking support in the face of the ego's trickery we gain that help. <br />
Divine Guidance and help reached to our Prophet through the Archangel Gabriel who acted as Allah's representative in carrying His revelation to the Prophets, so that Divine Help reaches to the Saints via the Holy Prophet, who acted as Allah Almighty's representative in bringing guidance to his Nation. And ultimately, after the Prophet's time, that guidance reaches to our hearts through the Saints, his inheritors, as we have not yet developed the senses with which to listen directly to the Prophet's guidance. Some foolish people, even among the Muslims, will undoubtedly deny this, saying that all that remains of the Holy Prophet's guidance is what is written in books. This point of view, far from being the reality, is a blind man's view, for were the Holy Prophet to have taken those powers with him upon his death there would remain no more religion, no more faith, no nothing from Islam. No, that prophetic power never leaves the Earth; it is only transformed and distributed through the awareness of the Holy Prophet's inheritors. <br />
Therefore, you must look for the support of the Saints in a Universe in which you are totally weak. Once you have established a good connection with such a person you will always be in contact with him: a &quot;wire&quot; will carry current to your heart from his power source. That aid will make itself felt most in times of need. Now it is daytime and you don't seek a torch, no need; but at night such a small light will prevent you from falling into a pit.</div></div><hr />
