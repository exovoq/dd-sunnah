 <br />
All praise is due to Allaah, Lord of all the worlds. Peace and blessings be upon the Messenger (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam), his household and companions. <br />
<br />
Fellow Muslims! Fear Allaah as He should be feared. Fear of Allaah is a reminder for His devoted servants and it is safety from His punishment.<br />
<br />
Dear brethren! Muslim woman attains prosperity by following the path of the best women who lived in the best generation and got nurtured in the house of Prophethood. They are women of high status and outstanding estimation. Allaah praises them in the Qur'aan where He says, <br />
<br />
&quot;O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. If you keep your duty (to Allaah), then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner.&quot; (Al-Ahzaab 33:32)<br />
<br />
They are blessed and great women. Foremost among them is that intelligent and wise woman, Khadeejah bint Khuwaylid, the religious and noble woman. She grew up upon virtuous characters and manners. She was chaste and gracious. She was known among Makkah women as 'the pure woman'. The Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) married her and she became an excellent wife for him. She supported him with her life, wealth and wisdom. During his sorrowful days, he would seek shelter with her and confide in her.<br />
<br />
When the first revelation came to him he went to his wife shaking, and he said, &quot;O Khadeejah, I fear for myself.&quot; But Khadeejah responded to his fear with a firm heart. And she told him, &quot;By Allaah, Allaah will not disgrace you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Islaam started in her house and she was the first person to embrace it. Ibn al-Atheer said, &quot;Khadeejah was the first person to embrace Islaam, according to the consensus of the Muslims. No man or woman ever embraced Islaam before her.&quot; <br />
<br />
At the beginning of the Prophet's mission, he was faced with many tribulations. But she stood by him compassionately and supported him with her outstanding intelligence. Whenever he heard any undesirable words from the people and came to her, she would strengthen and console him. The Prophet (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) said about her, &quot;She believed in me when the people denied me, she trusted me when people belied me; she supported me with her wealth when people refused to support me and I was blessed with children by her when I was denied children by other women.&quot; (Ahmad)<br />
<br />
Khadeejah was a great and dutiful wife to her husband and an affectionate mother to her children. She gave birth to all the Prophet's children except Ibraaheem. She was extremely good-mannered. She never argued with her husband and she never bothered him. The Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) said, &quot;Angel Jibreel came to me and said: 'Give Khadeejah the good tidings that she will have a palace made of hollowed pearls in Paradise and there will be neither noise nor any trouble in it.'&quot; (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim) <br />
<br />
As-Suhaylee said, &quot;She was given the glad tiding of a house in Paradise because she never raised her voice over that of the Prophet and she never bothered him.&quot; She was pleased with her Lord and Allaah is pleased with her. <br />
<br />
The Prophet (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) said, &quot;Paradise and there will be neither noise nor any trouble in it.'&quot; (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim)<br />
<br />
Ibn al-Qayyim said, &quot;Khadeejah was the only woman known to have this honour.&quot; <br />
<br />
Allaah loved Khadeejah, so did His angels. The Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) also loved her so much. He said, &quot;I am blessed with her love.&quot; (Muslim)<br />
<br />
Whenever the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) remembered her, he would mention her in glowing attributes and would show gratitude for her companionship. 'Aaishah said, &quot;Whenever the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) remembered Khadeejah, he would never tired of praising her and invoking Allaah's forgiveness for her. He appreciated her love and sincerity and he would honour her friends after her death.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Aaishah said, &quot;He would often slaughter a goat, cut it into parts and distribute it to Khadeejah's friends. And whenever I asked him, 'Are there no other women in the world except Khadeejah?' He would say, 'She was this and that and she bore me children.'&quot; (Al-Bukhaaree)<br />
<br />
After her death, Allaah's Messenger (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) heard her sister's voice. He them became sad and said, &quot;She reminded me of Khadeejah.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Khadeejah was perfect in her religion, wisdom and conduct. The Prophet (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) said, &quot;Many men attained perfection, but only three women attained it: Maryam, daughter of 'Imraan [Jesus' mother], Aasiyah, Pharaoh's wife and Khadeejah bint Khuwaylid.&quot; (Ibn Mardooyah)<br />
<br />
She preceded the women of this Ummah in righteousness, nobility and splendour. Allaah's Messenger said, &quot;Maryam [Mary, Jesus' mother] was the best woman of her time, and the best woman of this Ummah is Khadeejah.&quot; (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim)<br />
<br />
Khadeejah was righteous and made her home righteous. She reaped the fruit of her labour and she and her daughter became the best of the women of the worlds in Paradise. The Prophet (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) said, &quot;The best from the women of Paradise are: Khadeejah, Faatimah, Maryam [Mary] and 'Aasiyah.&quot; (Ahmad and An-Nasaa'ee)<br />
<br />
She occupied a great place in the Prophet's heart. He did not marry any woman before her neither did he marry any woman or have any concubine while she was still with him until she died. He was extremely distressed with her death. Adh-Dhahabee said, &quot;Khadeejah was intelligent, gracious, religious, chaste and noble. She is one of the dwellers of Paradise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dear brethren! Another great woman of the house of Prophethood is 'Aaishah, daughter of Aboo Bakr. She was born in the house of truthfulness and piety and she was nurtured in the house of eemaan. Her mother was a companion and her sister, Asmaa, Lady of the Two Girdles and her brother were also companions. Her father is the truthful man of this Ummah. She grew up in the house of knowledge, for her father was the erudite scholar of Quraysh and the highest authority in genealogy. Allaah endowed her with outstanding intelligence and a sharp memory. Ibn Katheer said, &quot;No nation has produced a woman as sharp, knowledgeable, fluent and intelligent as 'Aaishah.&quot; She excelled the women of her race in knowledge and wisdom. She was blessed with understanding of Islaamic jurisprudence and memorisation of poetry. She was in fact, a treasure of Islaamic sciences. Adh-Dhahabee said, &quot;The most knowledgeable woman of this Ummah is 'Aaishah. I do not know any woman from the Ummah of Muhammad or from any other nation more knowledgeable than her.&quot;<br />
<br />
She excelled all women with her virtues and beautiful companionship. Allaah's Messenger (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) said, &quot;The superiority of 'Aaishah over other women is like the superiority of thareed over other kinds of food.&quot; (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim)<br />
<br />
The Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) loved her; and he did not love anything but that which is pleasant. <br />
<br />
'Amr ibn al-'Aas once asked Allaah's Messenger (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam), &quot;Who is most beloved to you of all people?&quot; The Prophet answered, &quot;'Aaishah.&quot; And he said, &quot;And among men?&quot; And he answered, &quot;Her father.&quot; (Al-Bukhaaree)<br />
<br />
 She was the only virgin the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) married, and the revelation did not come to him in other woman's blanket but hers. She was chaste and devoted to her Lord. She did not go out of her house except in the night so that men could not see her. She said of herself, &quot;We did not use to go out but only in the night&quot;. This is in line with Allaah's instruction, <br />
<br />
&quot;And stay in your houses, and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance.&quot; (Al-Ahzaab 33:33)<br />
<br />
Al-Qurtubee said, &quot;There are resplendent evidences in Islaam that require women to stay at home and not to go out except when necessary. And when it becomes necessary for them to go out they should do so with complete covering of themselves and their adornments.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allaah puts whomever He wills to test, and the test is in accordance with one's eemaan. 'Aaishah was slandered while she was only twelve. She said, narrating her ordeal in this incidence, &quot;I wept and I could not sleep and I just kept weeping until my parents thought that my liver would burst from weeping.&quot; She said that the trial was so severe that she would weep but could not find any more tears to shed. <br />
<br />
Ibn Katheer said, &quot;So Allaah decided to defend her honour, and He revealed ten verses to absolve her. This elevated her status and these verses were recited and they shall continue to be recited till the Day of Resurrection. Allaah testified that she was one of the purest women and promised her forgiveness and a generous provision.<br />
<br />
She spent nights caring for the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) in his illness until he died in her apartment, on her day and in her bosom.<br />
<br />
Sawdah bint Zam'ah is another of the Prophet's noble wives. She was pure-hearted and the first woman he married after the death of Khadeejah. She was his only wife for about three years. She was gracious and noble, and the purity of her heart manifested when she gave her days with the Prophet to 'Aaishah out of consideration for her husband's feelings and in order to earn reward of her Lord.<br />
<br />
Another great woman in the Prophet's household is Hafsah, daughter of 'Umar. She was given to observing prayers in the night and performing supererogatory fasting. She grew up in a house in which the cause of Islaam was supported and truth was given prominence. Seven members of her family participated in the battle of Badr. 'Aaishah said of her, &quot;She was my only competitor among the Prophet's wives.&quot; <br />
 <br />
There is also Zaynab bint Khuzaymah al-Hilaaliyyah who was very generous and hastened to perform righteous deeds. She lived with Allaah's Messenger for only two months and then died. <br />
<br />
Another distinguished woman in the house of Prophethood is Umm Habeebah daughter of Aboo Sufyaan, the emigrant and the one who was given to performing meritorious deeds. She was the closest to the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) of his wives in terms of blood relation. There was no one among his wives who was more generous than her as far as charity giving is concerned. She migrated to Abyssinia, escaping with her religion. The king of Abyssinia paid her bridal gift on the Prophet's behalf and got her ready for him.<br />
<br />
Another outstanding wife of the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) was Umm Salamah, the patient and noble woman. Her name is Hind bint Abee Umayyah, one of the earliest emigrants. When she wanted to migrate to al-Madeenah with her husband Aboo Salamah, her clan separated between her and her husband and son. She said, &quot;Every morning I would go to Abtah [a valley in Makkah] and I would keep weeping until evening. I did so for a whole year or close to a year. They later pitied me and gave my son back to me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Her sure faith in Allaah was firm-rooted. When her first husband died, she said the invocation that Allaah's Messenger taught her, so Allaah gave her a better husband in the person of Allaah's Messenger (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam). Umm Salamah narrated that the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) said, &quot;If any Muslim who suffers some calamity says what Allaah has commanded him,&quot; We belong to Allah and to Him shall we return; O Allaah, reward me for my affliction and give me something better than it in exchange for it,&quot; Allah will give him something better than it in exchange.&quot; When Abu Salamah died she said: 'Which Muslim is better than Abu Salamah whose family was the first to emigrate to the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam)?' I then said those words, and Allaah gave me the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) in exchange.&quot; (Muslim)<br />
<br />
Make this supplication your treasure during afflictions, Allaah will provide you with what is better.<br />
<br />
Dear brethren! There is a woman among the Prophet's wives known as Mother of the Poor. She is Zaynab bint Jahsh whose mother is the Prophet's aunt. She enjoyed nobility of birth and character. She was described by Aboo Nu'aym as, 'devoted and ****************************ed woman'. Allaah married her to His Prophet through an explicit verse from His Book, <br />
<br />
&quot;So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage.&quot; (Al-Ahzaab 33:37)<br />
<br />
Her marriage to the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) is a blessing to the Muslim women till the day of Resurrection, for it was after her marriage that Allaah ordained hijaab for the women so that it could serve as a symbol of protection for their honour, chastity and purity.<br />
<br />
Zaynab was extremely generous to the poor and the weak. She was highly charitable. In spite of her nobility and high status, she used to work with her hands, tanning and making beads. And she would spend the proceeds for the poor. 'Aaishah said, &quot;I have not seen a woman better in her adherence to religion, more pious, kinder to the kith and kin and more generous in giving charity than Zaynab.&quot; <br />
<br />
Juwayriyyah bint al-Haarith from the tribe of Banoo al-Mustaliq is another of the Prophet's distinguished wives. Her father was the influential chief of his tribe. She was in herself blessed as she was blessed to her tribe. 'Aaishah said, &quot;I have not seen a woman who is greater in blessing to her people more than her.&quot; She was given to performing much acts of worship for her Lord. She sincerely and devotedly worshiped her Lord. She would sit down in her prayer place remembering her Lord after Fajr until mid-noon. She said, &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam)  came to me one morning while I was glorifying Allaah. He then went out for some of his needs. When he came back just before mid-noon he said, 'Are you still there remembering Allaah?' And I said, 'Yes.'&quot; (Muslim)<br />
<br />
Another honourable wife of Allaah's Messenger (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) is the beautiful Safiyyah bint Huyayy, a descendant of Prophet Haaroon [Aaron]. She was a noble and intelligent woman. She was highly-placed, religious, deliberate and peace-loving. The Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) told her, &quot;Indeed, you are a daughter of a Prophet [meaning Aaron], your uncle is a Prophet [meaning Moses]; and you are also married to a Prophet.&quot; (At-Tirmidhee)<br />
<br />
The feast of her marriage to the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) comprised only of butter, cottage cheese and dates. But the marriage was blessed. <br />
<br />
Maymoonah bint al-Haarith al-Hilaaliyyah, the woman who was given to being kind to the kith and kin is another eminent wife of the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam). She was one the greatest women. Allaah endowed her with pure heart and performance of much acts of worship. 'Aaishah said about her, &quot;She was one of the most pious and most generous to the kith and kin among us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fellow Muslims! That is the history of the outstanding women of Islaam, mothers of the faithful. Their virtues are glowing. They had combination of beauties and virtues. It is therefore, incumbent upon Muslim women to make them their models in matters of their religion, their submission to Allaah and His Messenger (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam), their conduct, their consciousness of Allaah, their performance of acts of worship, their truthfulness in words and their spending for the poor. They need to emulate them in their alleviation of other people's sufferings; and in their efforts to make their children righteous, correct them with patience and in seeking fortification through knowledge and learning from erudite scholars. <br />
<br />
They need to emulate them in keeping themselves properly covered, maintaining their chastity, staying at their homes and keeping away from doubtful and lustful things. They should emulate them by avoiding pinning their hopes on this world, heedlessness and forgetfulness or being carried away by outward beauties while the inward is corrupt. <br />
<br />
The Muslim women should avoid looking at forbidden things and engaging in amorous conversations with alien men. They should beware of those who are calling to the removal of hijaab and mixing with men. <br />
<br />
Muslim woman's greatness and glory lie in her religion and her hijaab. Allaah says,<br />
<br />
&quot;O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allaah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&quot; (Al-Israa 33:59)<br />
<br />
Dear Muslims! The Prophet's wives lived with him humbly in apartments built of brick and palm leaves, but full of eemaan and piety. They showed patience with the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) over poverty and hunger. Sometimes, a month or two would pass with no cooking fire kindled in their homes. They would spend days with nothing to eat but only dates and water. Sometimes they would make do with water only. Yet they lived in ****************************edness and patience upon Allaah's promise that,<br />
<br />
&quot;The Hereafter is better for you than the present (life of this world).&quot; (Ad-Duhaa 93:4)<br />
<br />
And His promise,<br />
<br />
&quot;And whosoever of you is obedient to Allaah and His Messenger (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) and does righteous good deeds, We shall give her, her reward twice over, and We have prepared for her a noble provision.&quot; (Al-Ahzaab 33:31)<br />
<br />
Brethren in Islaam! The Prophet (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam) married five of his wives with their ages ranging between forty and sixty. By that he was able to lay an example in taking care of the widow and their orphaned children. He married Khadeejah while she was forty years old, with three children from the previous marriage, while he was unmarried before. He married Zaynab bint Khuzaymah who was an almost sixty-year-old widow. He married Umm Salamah who was a widow with six children. He married Sawdah who was a fifty-five years old widow. He married some relatives from among his cousins. And he married some women who were not his relatives. He was a compassionate, dutiful and honourable husband to them all. He lived with them in the most beautiful way. He was always cheerful and kind to them.<br />
<br />
Therefore, let those who want to prosper emulate the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam), who is the best of all creatures. Let the Muslim women follow the path of the righteous wives of the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alayihi wa sallam). For, there is no success for any woman except by following the path of these pious ladies in their righteousness and God-consciousness and in their dutifulness to their husband and children.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Umm Waraqah bint ëAbdullaah bin Haarith Ansariah <br />
<br />
(radiallaahu ëanhaa)<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Prophet, salAllaahu ëalaihi wa salaam said:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
ì Umm Waraqah! Dwell in your House, Allaah will give you the death of a martyrî<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Ansaar of Al-Madeenah were standing on the outskirts of their city, looking with inpatient eyes towards the road approaching from Makkah.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Men, women, girls and boys, the young and the old were waiting for the arrival of their beloved Prophet salAllaahu ëalaihi wa salaam who was migrating from his city to theirs at their invitation and at the command of Allaah, subhanna wa taíalaa. Suddenly someone shouted, ì Here they come!î. And all the young girls and women burst into a song of praise of Allaah subhanna wa taíalaa and a welcome to His Messenger salAllaahu ëalaihi wa salaam.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Among the Ansaaree women was Umm Waraaqah bint ëAbdullaah radiallaahu ëanha. She was a learned, scholarly, pious and modest lady , who was well known amongst the female companions (May Allaah be pleased with them) as one who spent her nights and days in prayer and meditation. She used to recite the Noble Quíraan beautifully; it was second nature for her to spend a lot of time meditating on the meaning of its Verses.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Prophet salAllaahu ëalaihi wa salaam valued her highly and he told her to lead the family in congregational prayers. The courtyard of the house was converted into a masjid; with the permission of the Prophet salAllaahu ëalaihi wa salaam they had a Muíaadheen to give the call for prayers. ëAbdur-Rahmaan bin Khaalad says that he saw the Muíaadheen, who was a very aged man. Thus Umm Waraqah bint ëAbdullaah radiallaahu ëanhaa was appointed by the Prophet salAllaahu ëalaihi wa salaam to be an Imaam and lead the prayers for the women.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Besides her thirst for knowledge of the Quíraan, Sharíeeah (Islaamic legislation) and Ahaadeeth, Umm Waraqaah radiallaahu ëanhaa had a burning desire to die as a martyr in the cause of al-Islaam. When it was announced that the army should prepare to leave for the battle of Badr, Umm Waraaqah radiallaahu ëanhaa went to the Prophet salAllaahu ëalaihi wa salaam and volunteered her services to tend to the wounded in the battlefield. She told him salAllaahu ëalaihi wa salaam that it was her earnest desire to die in the cause of al-Islaam. The Prophet salAllaahu ëalaihi wa salaam could see her enthusiasm and ardour but he told her to stay at home and she would attain martyrdom there. She went back happily because it was her duty to yield to the command of the Messenger of Allaah salAllaahu ëalaihi wa salaam.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Prophet salAllaahu ëalaihi wa salaam would sometimes take along some of His Companions and visit the home of Umm Waraaqah radiallaahu ëanhaa. He would tell them to accompany him to the house of the lady who was a living martyr. He would ask about her welfare, rest for awhile and then offer supplications to Allaah, the High, for her well being and return. Allaah subhanna wa taíalaa revealed to His beloved Messenger salAllaahu ëalaihi wa salaam that Umm Waraaqaah radiallaahu ëanhaa would die the death of a martyr in her own home. Nobody could understand how this would take place with her sitting in her house, but they were sure it would definitly happen, as this news had been given by their truthful Prophet salAllaahu ëalaihi wa salaam.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Umm Waraqaah radiallaahu ëanhaa herself was awaiting every moment to see how this auspicious event, which would be the fulfillment of her greatest dream, would take place. She waited patiently, for it would give her eternal life and a place in Paradise. When would it take place? How exactly would it take place? What shape would it take? How would it be possible to become a martyr sitting in the house? Lossed in these thoughts she passed her nights and her days. The Prophet salAllaahu ëalaihi wa salaam passed. Abu Bakr Siddique radiallaahu ëanhu succeeded and he also passed; ëUmaar Farooq radiallaahu ëanhu became the Khalifa.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Umm Waraqaah radiallaahu ëanhaa had two slaves working for her, a girl and a man. She told them that after her death they would be free. One day they got together and decided that they were tired of waiting for this old lady to die. The planned to kill her in her sleep and escape to freedom. They were so tempted by the thought of freedom that they forgot to consider their future as well as their life in the Aakhiraah.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
In the dead of night as Umm Waraqah radiallaahu ëanhaa lay in a deep sleep, they killed her, covered her body with a sheet and crept away from the house silently. As day broke and the sun came up, the neighbours missed the sound of the beautiful recitation of the Noble Quíraan by Umm Waraqaah radiallaahu ëanhaa which used to fill the air early in the dawn. When they entered the house they were shocked to see her lying in the sleep of death. Then they saw that both the slaves were missing. They realized that they must be criminals. ëUmaar ibn al-Khattaab radiallaahu ëanhu ordered that people should be sent out to search for them. Finally, they were found hiding. When they were brought before the Khalifa in court, they admitted their guilt and were put to death.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Thus the Prophet salAllaahu ëalaihi wa salaam was proven right, that Umm Waraqaah radiallaahu ëanhaa died the death of a martyr in her own home, and attained Jannah.<br />
<br />

Verily, the pious will be in the midst of Gardens and Rivers. In a seat of truth, near the Omnipotent King (Allaah, the One, the All-Blessed, the Most High, the Owner of Majesty and Honour) ñ 54:54-55<br />

Zainab bint Jahsh (radiallahu anha)<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
When Zainab (radiallahu anha) passed away, 'Aishah (radiallahu anha) recalled an occasion when the Prophet (salla lahu alaihi wa sallam) said that among the Mother of the Believers, she would meet him first who had the longest arms.  Zainab (radiallahu anha) was short compared to the others<br />
and naturally her arms were also shorter.  All the ladies took this statement literally and started measuring their arms.  It was only upon the death of Zainab (radiallahu anhu) that they realized what this meant.  It really meant that the person with the longest arms was the most generous or liberal<br />
person, who only thought of how she could benefit others.  There was an implicit prophecy in this statement, which became clear when Zainab (radiallahu anhu) passed away.  It meant she would meet him in Paradise before the others.  And she passed away before any of the other wives of the Prophet (salla lahu alaihi wa sallam).  'Aishah (radiallahu anha) says Zainab (radiallahu anha) worked with her own hands, and what she thus earned she spent on works of charity.  She says she was a God-fearing, straight-forward lady who practiced abstinence.  All her actions were aimed at pleasing Allah (subhana wa ta'ala).  Sometimes she would lose her temper, but then she was quick to repent and ask for forgiveness.  She was very pure at heart and never carried resentments and grudges.<br />

<br />
Sawdah ( Radi Allahu Anha)<br />
<br />
Sawdah bint Zam'ah, she was the first woman the Prophet (Salla Allahu Alaihe wa Salaam) married after Khadijahs death. She was the Prophets only wife for three or more years, until he married Aisha.<br />
<br />
She is the one who gave her night to Aisha taking in to consideration the feelings of the Messenger of Allah. An ayat was revealed pertaining to her, when she feared that the Prophet (Salla Allahu Alaihe wa Salaam) was going to divorce her. She said, &quot;Don't divorce me, keep me and give my day to Aisha&quot; So the verse was revealed,(So if a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her husbands part,there is no sin on them both if they make terms of peace between themselves;and making peace is better. And human inner-selves are swayed by greed. But if you do good and keep away from evil,verily, Allah is Ever Well Aquainted with what you do. An Nisa 4:128)<br />
<br />
There are five ahadith which  were narrated by her! <br />
