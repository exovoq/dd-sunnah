<br />
Why a Jew can grow his beard in order to practice his faith <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
But when Muslim does the same, he is an extremist and terrorist!<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Muslem<br />
<br />
Nun<br />
<br />
 <br />
Why a nun can be covered from head to toe in order to devote herself to God<br />
<br />
<br />
But when Muslimah does the same she oppressed<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Hijab<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Western Women<br />
<br />
 <br />
When a western woman stays at home to look after her house and kids she is<br />
<br />
respected because of sacrificing herself and doing well for the household? <br />
<br />
<br />
But when a Muslim woman does so by her will, they say, &quot;she needs to be<br />
<br />
liberated&quot;!<br />
<br />
 <br />
Muslim Women<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anything<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Any girl can go to university wearing what she wills and have her rights and<br />
<br />
freedom?<br />
<br />
<br />
But when Muslimah wears a Hijab they prevent her from entering her<br />
<br />
university!<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Hijab<br />
<br />
<br />
Subject<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
When a child dedicates himself to a subject he has potential.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But when he dedicates himself to Islam he is hopeless!<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Islam<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Question<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
When a Christian or a Jew kills someone religion is not mentioned, but when<br />
<br />
Muslim is charged with a crime, it is Islam that goes to trial! <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Question<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Hero<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
When someone sacrfices himself to keep others alive, he is noble and all<br />
<br />
respect him.<br />
<br />
<br />
But when a Palestinian does that to save his son from being killed, his<br />
<br />
brother's arm being broken, his mother being raped, his home being<br />
<br />
destroyed, and his mosque being violated -- He gets the title of a<br />
<br />
terrorist! Why? Because he is a Muslim! <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Terrorist<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Question<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
When there is a trouble we accept any solution? If the solution lies in<br />
<br />
Islam, we refuse to take a look at it. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Question<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Car<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
When someone drives a perfect car in a bad way no one blames the car.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
But when any Muslim makes a mistake or treats people in a bad manner -<br />
<br />
people say &quot;Islam is the reason&quot;! <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Islam<br />
<br />
<br />
Newspapers<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Without looking to the tradition of Islam, people believe what the<br />
<br />
newspapers say.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
But question what the Quran says!</div></div><hr />
