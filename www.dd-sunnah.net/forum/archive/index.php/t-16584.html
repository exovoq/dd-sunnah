<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StraightPath</div><div class="date">05-07-03, 05:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assalamu alaikom, May Allah reward you for your efforts in Da'wah, I just had a few reccomendations that came into my mind when I thought about referring English Speaking Sunnis to this board:<br />
1- Putting a link that says clearly &quot;English&quot; on the main page, so the site would be easier to visit.<br />
2-Making the options such as choosing the font size etc, and basically everything related to posting and reading psosts, completely in English, otherwise no English speaker would feel comfortable posting. I dont think that would be too hard of a task for you guy insha'Allah.<br />
3- The is kinda &quot;offtopic&quot; but if the moderator of this board, or even the ******************** of this site knows how to edit videos, or knows someone that could, then I recommend, translating the videos of what the Rafidhee scholars say, such as &quot;Jesus would be honered to be a slave of Ali Bin Abee Talib, so it could be basically a text in the video ( ie a caption ). I know SO MANY people that would really benefit from this, as we Arabic speaking people, live around shias, we have a basic understanding of them without the videos even. However when the shias live abroad, they flat out lie to others who dont have a clue what they say/do &quot;back home&quot;, this may be a hard task, but I just wanted the idea to be out there, maybe it would spread and somebody would do it in the future insha'Allah. <br />
Again Jazakom Allah khair for your efforts, Wassalamu alaikom</div></div><hr />
