by Joan Goldwasser, Kimberly Lankford and Pat Mertz Esswein<br />
Thursday, September 18, 2008<br />
<br />
We have frank answers to your tough questions about banks, brokers and mortgage middlemen. <br />
<br />
When IndyMac bank failed this summer, the lines of nervous account holders trying to withdraw their money made headlines everywhere. But that was an anomaly.<br />
<br />
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has taken over ten other banks this year without incident. If you are worried about the safety of your money -- in banks or brokerages, such as Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy September 14 -- or money you've paid your mortgage servicer for taxes or insurance, here are answers to your pressing questions.<br />
<br />
Your Banker<br />
<br />
Should<br />
<br />
I worry about the safety of my bank accounts? In most instances, your money is insured by the FDIC, which is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, up to a limit of $100,000 at each bank. Add up all the accounts in your name at a bank, including checking, savings and money-market accounts as well as certificates of deposit. If your funds total more than $100,000, move the excess to another bank.<br />
<br />
My spouse and I have a joint checking account, and each of us has individual savings accounts at the same bank. How much insurance does each of us have? Each co-owner of a joint account has $100,000 in insurance, and your individual accounts are each insured for $100,000, for a total of $400,000 in this example. If you want to shelter more cash, you can open revocable-trust or payable-on-death (POD) accounts for your spouse, children, grandchildren or siblings. Each beneficiary's account is insured up to $100,000. Or you can just move the excess cash to another bank.<br />
<br />
My retirement-savings accounts are with my bank. What is the maximum coverage for them? Certain types of retirement accounts are covered by FDIC insurance, including IRAs, Roth IRAs, SEP IRAs and Keogh plans. All deposits in these types of accounts are added together and insured up to $250,000 per person. If you have both a regular and a Roth IRA, the assets would be added together and insured up to $250,000.<br />
<br />
I bank at a credit union. Is my money insured? Yes. The National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF), which was established by Congress and is backed by the U.S. government, insures individual accounts up to $100,000. As with FDIC insurance, a two-person joint account is insured up to $200,000.<br />
<br />
Are my credit-union retirement accounts insured? Yes, the NCUSIF covers retirement accounts, too. The funds in traditional and Roth IRAs are added together and insured up to $250,000; Keogh accounts are insured separately up to $250,000. If you have both IRAs and a Keogh at your credit union, you can have a total of $500,000 in insured retirement assets.<br />
<br />
I have a bank money-market account. Are those funds insured? Yes, but your money-market deposit account is lumped with all other accounts bearing your name, and together they are insured up to $100,000. Money that you keep in a money-market mutual fund is not insured. Unlike most mutual funds, however, the share price does not fluctuate -- it usually remains a constant $1. However, the Reserve Primary Fund, which holds securities issued by bankrupt Lehman Brothers, announced September 16 that its share price fell below $1.<br />
<br />
If the FDIC takes over my bank, as it recently did with IndyMac Bank, how long will it take for me to have access to my money? IndyMac's depositors had continuous access to their funds through ATM and debit cards. After federal regulators seized the bank on a Friday, some customers did not have online or phone access for a weekend, but everyone had full access to all their insured money by Monday morning.<br />
<br />
If the FDIC takes over my bank, will I lose all my uninsured funds? No. IndyMac account holders had access to 50% of their uninsured funds immediately. When Mutual of Omaha Bank took over First National Bank of Nevada and First Heritage Bank of Newport Beach, Cal., in July, depositors had immediate access to both insured and uninsured funds.<br />
<br />
How can I check to see if all my money is insured? Both the FDIC's Web site and the National Credit Union ********************istration's site have a calculator that allows you to plug in all your accounts and the amounts deposited so you can find out whether any of your money is uninsured. Go to www.fdic.gov and click on the Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator (EDIE), or go to www.ncua.gov and use its Share Insurance Estimator Report.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your Broker<br />
<br />
What happens to my brokerage account if my firm goes bankrupt? Brokerage firms must follow strict rules about segregating customers' investments from the firm's money, so your accounts should remain intact even if the brokerage goes under and another firm takes over its business. For example, stocks, bonds and mutual funds are physically held by an independent depository, not the brokerage firm.<br />
<br />
What if the firm misappropriated my assets? You have another layer of protection in case the firm hasn't followed all of the rules: The Securities Investor Protection Corp. covers stocks, bonds and other assets held at a brokerage firm that goes bust, and nearly every brokerage firm registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission must be a member. &quot;We get involved only when a firm has used up its capital and has misappropriated customers' securities,&quot; says Stephen Harbeck, president and chief executive of SIPC.<br />
<br />
If a brokerage firm fails, SIPC first tries to transfer the investors' securities to another firm. If that doesn't work, it then attempts to rebuild the investors' portfolios, even buying new stocks or bonds to make up for any missing shares. If the investments aren't available, SIPC will give you cash based on their value when the brokerage failed.<br />
<br />
How much does SIPC cover? SIPC first returns your share of the broker's remaining assets, then uses its own funds (up to $500,000 per account, including a $100,000 limit on cash) to buy the same shares that you originally owned.<br />
<br />
What happens if I have more than $500,000 at that brokerage firm? The $500,000 limit applies only to the maximum amount of its own money SIPC will spend to make up for any missing securities, not the total amount of money you can get back. If the customers' assets remain largely intact at the brokerage firm, then you can get back a lot more than that SIPC limit, which is a key difference between how SIPC protects brokerage customers and how the FDIC covers bank depositors.<br />
<br />
In the 38-year history of SIPC, only 349 people have not received the full value of their accounts from their share of the firm's assets plus SIPC coverage -- and most of those instances occurred three decades ago or more.<br />
<br />
If an investor's losses exceed SIPC's limits, the difference is usually covered by the broker's supplemental insurance -- often provided by Lloyd's of London or a new firm called Capco, the Customer Asset Protection Co. Capco provides coverage above SIPC limits to 15 major brokerage firms, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Raymond James and Wa-chovia Securities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do I have access to my money after SIPC takes over? That's the most common problem. It tends to take from one week to two or three months to regain control of your account while SIPC sorts everything out. It can take even longer if the brokerage firm kept shoddy records or was involved in fraud. SIPC does not protect against market losses while your account is in limbo.<br />
<br />
For more information about how SIPC works, and to make sure your brokerage firm is a member, go to the SIPC Web site.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your Lender<br />
<br />
What if my mortgage lender or servicer goes belly up? The problem is the lender's, not yours. Continue paying your mortgage as before. During the bankruptcy process, your lender will transfer your loan file to a new owner or servicer, and both parties will notify you by letter. If you mistakenly send your payment to the old lender's address, you won't owe a late fee if you're within the federally mandated 60-day grace period after the transfer.<br />
<br />
But what happens to my escrowed funds for taxes and insurance? The money belongs to you, held in trust, so it won't become part of the lender's bankruptcy assets. The new servicer will take over making tax and insurance payments from the account. As a backstop, review your monthly mortgage statement and the escrow account analysis that you should receive from the new servicer within 45 days of the transfer. If anything seems awry, call your lender or servicer, the property-tax office or your insurance company.<br />

<br />
by Brett Arends<br />
Monday, September 15, 2008<br />
provided by<br />
<br />
Here are ten things that this financial panic means for you.<br />
<br />
1. Check that your bank accounts are federally insured. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) guarantees deposits up to $100,000 per person. If you have to hold more than that, spread it across multiple banks. As a taxpayer you are paying for this insurance. Use it.<br />
<br />
2. Make sure your brokerage accounts are federally insured, too. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) guarantees you at places like Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, E-Trade and the like up to $500,000, including $100,000 worth of cash. The same rules apply: If you have more to invest, spread it across multiple firms. Note: The SIPC is only there to make sure you get your shares and bonds back if a brokerage fails. It does not, obviously, guarantee those investments' value.<br />
<br />
3. Put money in thy purse. If this market and this economy get any tougher, cash isn't just going to be king any more. It's going to be king, queen, emperor, lord high chamberlain, and the whole court ñ including the royal cat and crazy prince Ruprecht locked in the attic. The easiest way to make or find a buck is to save it. So take an axe to those family budgets. The restaurant meals. The Super Duper Everything Cable package. The rip-off checking account with the high fees and low interest. It's all costing you.<br />
<br />
4. Set up a home equity line of credit while you still can. I usually don't like advising people to take on more debt, but if access to ready cash might be a life saver it's best to line it up. That's especially true if you are worried about your job. Credit is already tight, and it may get a lot tighter still.<br />
<br />
5. Refinance your mortgage. The panic on Wall Street just caused a collapse in the interest rate on long-term US Treasury bonds, as lots of investors rushed there for safety. And that usually leads to a fall in long-term mortgage rates.<br />
<br />
6. Stop pulling a Monty Python when it comes to your worst investments. If you ever saw John Cleese and Michael Palin perform their famous skit about the dead parrot, you know exactly what I mean. No, your Fannie Mae shares aren't &quot;resting.&quot; They're lying at the bottom of the cage with their feet in the air. What more do you need to know? So stop waiting for them to &quot;recover&quot; before sorting out your portfolio.<br />
<br />
7. Don't panic. Journalists, like markets, tend to move in herds. And by the nature of their jobs they write about the plane that crashes instead of the thousands that land safely. Remember, too, that pundits want to seem really wise by putting on serious expressions and saying things like &quot;we don't know how this thing is going to play out,&quot; and &quot;the situation could get a lot worse&quot;. Bah. Guess what? We never know how things are going to play out. And the situation could get a lot better too. That's the future for you.<br />
<br />
8. When it comes to your short-term money needs, nothing has changed. Any money you might need within the next year or two should be held in cash or equivalents. That was true two years ago and it is true now. The stock market is no home for money you may need urgently. It could fall 30% or jump 30%. Nobody knows. You can get a one year CD paying 5% right now, and it's federally guaranteed.<br />
<br />
9. If you are investing for five years or more, buy some stock. The investment outlook is much, much better today than it has been for several years, because shares are much cheaper. World markets overall have fallen 27% from last year's peak. They're not a steal at current levels but they are not particularly expensive either. Invest globally. Vanguard Total World Stock gives you the whole world and low fees. If you are looking for a value focus, Morningstar analyst Bridget Hughes likes Oakmark Global. Another good one is Tweedy, Browne's new Worldwide High Dividend Yield Value. The list is not comprehensive. Remember: I am not trying to call the bottom of the market. Things could fall quite a bit further ahead. No one knows. So only invest little, often, and broadly.<br />
<br />
10. If you want to worry about anything, worry about your taxes. The worse this crisis gets, the more they will end up putting the taxpayer on the hook to prevent a meltdown. Taxes are going up sooner or later anyway, no matter who wins the election, because of our gigantic federal deficits. (If you think Lehman Brothers was bad, you should look at Uncle Sam). And you can forget about any talk of tax breaks. Oh, and if you want a break from worrying about taxes, worry about Treasury bonds. Deficits won't do anything good for them.<br />

Savers Find Ways to Boost <br />
Their Deposit Insurance; <br />
PODs, CDARS and CDs<br />
As the financial system reels from one disaster after another, financial planners, estate planners and bank officials say they've been receiving calls from panicked savers concerned about the safety of their deposits.<br />
<br />
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. guarantees bank deposits up to $100,000 per person, per insured institution. But what if you have a lot more cash than that?<br />
<br />
For years, savers have gotten around the FDIC's $100,000 limit by spreading their cash across multiple institutions. It's certainly safe, but it's an onerous process. Now, growing numbers of people are turning to other means that allow them to keep hundreds of thousands of dollars safely stowed away under FDIC protection.<br />
<br />
One product that has been attracting attention lately is an informal trust account known as a &quot;payable on death,&quot; or POD, account. To set up a POD account, depositors must name a beneficiary or beneficiaries who will receive money if the primary account holder dies. For each qualified beneficiary, the FDIC will boost insurance coverage by up to $100,000.<br />
<br />
Other strategies include:<br />
<br />
Brokered CDs. Buying multiple certificates of deposit at once through a brokerage firm provides a fast way to spread out money across different institutions, capturing the full FDIC protection.<br />
<br />
In recent weeks, Dan Kohn of New York started using brokered CDs through Vanguard Group's Vanguard Brokerage Services as a way to quickly spread out his money across different banks. He could probably find higher yields by searching for local deals, but brokered CDs provide a &quot;mixture of convenience and safety,&quot; says the 35-year-old Mr. Kohn, the chief operating officer of the Linux Foundation, a nonprofit group that promotes the use of the Linux computer operating system. &quot;I don't want to set up eight new accounts.&quot;<br />
<br />
CDARS. This deposit-placement service, short for Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service, disperses deposits into different individual CDs of up to $100,000 each, up to a maximum covered amount of $50 million. Customers deposit their money with a participating bank, and CDARS -- which is run by the Promontory Interfinancial Network LLC in Arlington, Va. -- disperses the deposit in individual CDs up to $100,000 in 2,350 member banks across the country.<br />
<br />
Retirement accounts. Money deposited in IRAs, Roth IRAs and certain other retirement plans is insured up to $250,000.<br />
<br />
Joint accounts. Deposit accounts owned by two or more people are insured up to $100,000 for each account holder listed.<br />
<br />
Credit unions. Deposit insurance for credit unions works in much the same way as FDIC insurance does for banks and thrifts, except that the funds are insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.<br />
<br />
Revocable trusts. Under this estate-planning strategy, the owner assigns beneficiaries but retains control of the assets during his lifetime. The FDIC insures the interests of each beneficiary up to $100,000 each. Some are formal trusts, which are typically set up by an estate attorney. Others, such as POD accounts, can be created when the account owners add certain terms and the names of the beneficiaries to the bank's account records.<br />
<br />
William Wright, a financial planner in Wichita, Kan., says he's working with one client who has over $1 million at a local bank to move the money into other types of deposit accounts, such as trust and joint accounts, and products such as annuities.<br />
<br />
On the basis of ease alone, POD accounts appear to be finding a larger audience lately. The FDIC doesn't publish data on the number of these accounts, but the agency confirms it is getting more questions from consumers about how to set them up and has been seeing more of them on the books when it takes over banks after they fail. So far this year, there have been 11 bank failures, and 117 banks that were on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s &quot;watch list&quot; at the end of the second quarter.<br />
<br />
Last spring, Robert Ring of Boise, Idaho, added his three children as beneficiaries to a money-market deposit account at IndyMac Bank. That meant his account, which totaled $300,000 at the time, was fully insured.<br />
<br />
Thanks to that move, &quot;it was a total nonevent for me&quot; when IndyMac collapsed in July, says the 39-year-old software engineer. &quot;I heard about the closure on a Friday afternoon, and all my money -- about $150,000 at the time -- was there the following Monday.&quot; He's also using PODs to protect money he's parked in a savings account at Alliant Credit Union in Chicago.<br />
<br />
For savers, PODs can be a quick way to extend their FDIC coverage without the hassle and paperwork of opening multiple accounts across several institutions. &quot;It's a convenience factor,&quot; says Mr. Ring. &quot;You can get your FDIC coverage by setting up accounts at six different banks, but that's just a headache, come tax time, with all the extra paperwork and 1099s you have to wait for.&quot;<br />
<br />
POD accounts do come with certain limitations. For starters, only certain relatives count as qualified beneficiaries. Spouses, children, grandchildren, parents and siblings are OK. Nieces, nephews and grandparents aren't. The depositor retains control of the account until his death, in which case the money is distributed to the beneficiaries.<br />
<br />
When the POD account contradicts the depositor's will, it can send family members to court to fight over the estate. Austin Frye, a financial planner and estate attorney in Aventura, Fla., says he's seen cases where clients inadvertently disinherited their children in a POD account.<br />
<br />
Mr. Frye recalls one case in which one of his clients had been added to his father's CD to help manage the account. When the father died, the money in the CD went directly to that son -- even though his will had specified that the money was to be split equally between the custodial son and another son who lived out of state.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could ruin your estate plan,&quot; Mr. Frye says. &quot;The courts are loaded with these cases.&quot;<br />
<br />
Geoff Sauter of Dover, Mass., says he got some conflicting advice on how to set up a POD account. Based on the advice of one representative at T. Rowe Price Group Inc., he decided to add his wife and three children to a CD to make sure his $400,000 was fully covered. A few days later, after his wife's broker questioned that strategy, he called back the firm and spoke with a different person who told him his deposits weren't fully covered. &quot;So I panicked and started calling other people,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
The 58-year-old engineering-firm salesman says T. Rowe Price eventually got back to him and told him that his money was, in fact, fully covered. &quot;Apparently, there is some confusion in the industry,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's unfortunate that in the course of several conversations, Mr. Sauter was given some conflicting information,&quot; says Brian Lewbart, a spokesman for T. Rowe Price. &quot;But in the end, we're certainly pleased he ended up with the correct information.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite the multitude of options, many savers still choose to spread their risk around by simply opening accounts at different banks. D.C. Harris, a retired accountant who lives in the San Francisco Bay area, had her money parked in a CD at Wachovia Corp. But worries about the solvency of that bank and others, such as Washington Mutual Inc., recently prompted her to put her savings in CDs at other banks, including Citigroup Inc.'s Citibank.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm more scared than I've been in my life about our economy and our banks,&quot; says the 65-year-old. &quot;I'm thinking about moving my money to United Bank of the Mattress.&quot;<br />

by Jon Hilsenrath, Serena Ng and Damian Paletta<br />
Wednesday, September 17, 2008<br />
provided by<br />
<br />
The financial crisis that began 13 months ago has entered a new, far more serious phase.<br />
<br />
Lingering hopes that the damage could be contained to a handful of financial institutions that made bad bets on mortgages have evaporated. New fault lines are emerging beyond the original problem -- troubled subprime mortgages -- in areas like credit-default swaps, the credit insurance contracts sold by American International Group Inc. and others firms. There's also a growing sense of wariness about the health of trading partners.<br />
<br />
<br />
The consequences for companies and chief executives who tarry -- hoping for better times in which to raise capital, sell assets or acknowledge losses -- are now clear and brutal, as falling share prices and fearful lenders send troubled companies into ever-deeper holes. This weekend, such a realization led John Thain to sell the century-old Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to Bank of America Corp. Each episode seems to bring intervention by the government that is more extensive and expensive than the previous one, and carries greater risk of unintended consequences.<br />
<br />
Expectations for a quick end to the crisis are fading fast. &quot;I think it's going to last a lot longer than perhaps we would have anticipated,&quot; Anne Mulcahy, chief executive of Xerox Corp., said Wednesday.<br />
<br />
&quot;This has been the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. There is no question about it,&quot; said Mark Gertler, a New York University economist who worked with fellow academic Ben Bernanke, now the Federal Reserve chairman, to explain how financial turmoil can infect the overall economy. &quot;But at the same time we have the policy mechanisms in place fighting it, which is something we didn't have during the Great Depression.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spreading Disease<br />
<br />
The U.S. financial system resembles a patient in intensive care. The body is trying to fight off a disease that is spreading, and as it does so, the body convulses, settles for a time and then convulses again. The illness seems to be overwhelming the self-healing tendencies of markets. The doctors in charge are resorting to ever-more invasive treatment, and are now experimenting with remedies that have never before been applied. Fed Chairman Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, walking into a hastily arranged meeting with congressional leaders Tuesday night to brief them on the government's unprecedented rescue of AIG, looked like exhausted surgeons delivering grim news to the family.<br />
<br />
Fed and Treasury officials have identified the disease. It's called deleveraging, or the unwinding of debt. During the credit boom, financial institutions and American households took on too much debt. Between 2002 and 2006, household borrowing grew at an average annual rate of 11%, far outpacing overall economic growth. Borrowing by financial institutions grew by a 10% annualized rate. Now many of those borrowers can't pay back the loans, a problem that is exacerbated by the collapse in housing prices. They need to reduce their dependence on borrowed money, a painful and drawn-out process that can choke off credit and economic growth.<br />
<br />
At least three things need to happen to bring the deleveraging process to an end, and they're hard to do at once. Financial institutions and others need to fess up to their mistakes by selling or writing down the value of distressed assets they bought with borrowed money. They need to pay off debt. Finally, they need to rebuild their capital cushions, which have been eroded by losses on those distressed assets.<br />
<br />
But many of the distressed assets are hard to value and there are few if any buyers. Deleveraging also feeds on itself in a way that can create a downward spiral: Trying to sell assets pushes down the assets' prices, which makes them harder to sell and leads firms to try to sell more assets. That, in turn, suppresses these firms' share prices and makes it harder for them to sell new shares to raise capital. Mr. Bernanke, as an academic, dubbed this self-feeding loop a &quot;financial accelerator.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Many of the CEO types weren't willing...to take these losses, and say, 'I accept the fact that I'm selling these way below fundamental value,'&quot; says Anil Kashyap, a University of Chicago Business School economics professor. &quot;The ones that had the biggest exposure, they've all died.&quot;<br />
<br />
Borrowing Slowdown<br />
<br />
Deleveraging started with securities tied to subprime mortgages, where defaults started rising rapidly in 2006. But the deleveraging process has now spread well beyond, to commercial real estate and auto loans to the short-term commitments on which investment banks rely to fund themselves. In the first quarter, financial-sector borrowing slowed to a 5.1% growth rate, about half of the average from 2002 to 2007. Household borrowing has slowed even more, to a 3.5% pace.<br />
<br />
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economist Jan Hatzius estimates that in the past year, financial institutions around the world have already written down $408 billion worth of assets and raised $367 billion worth of capital.<br />
<br />
But that doesn't appear to be enough. Every time financial firms and investors suggest that they've written assets down enough and raised enough new capital, a new wave of selling triggers a reevaluation, propelling the crisis into new territory. Residential mortgage losses alone could hit $636 billion by 2012, Goldman estimates, triggering widespread retrenchment in bank lending. That could shave 1.8 percentage points a year off economic growth in 2008 and 2009 -- the equivalent of $250 billion in lost goods and services each year.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a deleveraging like nothing we've ever seen before,&quot; said Robert Glauber, now a professor of Harvard's government and law schools who came to the Washington in 1989 to help organize the savings and loan cleanup of the early 1990s. &quot;The S&amp;L losses to the government were small compared to this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hedge funds could be among the next problem areas. Many rely on borrowed money to amplify their returns. With banks under pressure, many hedge funds are less able to borrow this money now, pressuring returns. Meanwhile, there are growing indications that fewer investors are shifting into hedge funds while others are pulling out. Fund investors are dealing with their own problems: Many have taken out loans to make their investments and are finding it more difficult now to borrow.<br />
<br />
That all makes it likely that more hedge funds will shutter in the months ahead, forcing them to sell their investments, further weighing on the market.<br />
<br />
History of Trauma<br />
<br />
Debt-driven financial traumas have a long history, from the Great Depression to the S&amp;L crisis to the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. Neither economists nor policymakers has easy solutions. Cutting interest rates and writing stimulus checks to families can help -- and may have prevented or delayed a deep recession. But, at least in this instance, they don't suffice.<br />
<br />
In such circumstances, governments almost invariably experiment with solutions with varying degrees of success. Franklin Delano Roosevelt unleashed an alphabet soup of new agencies and a host of new regulations in the aftermath of the market crash of 1929. In the 1990s, Japan embarked on a decade of often-wasteful government spending to counter the aftereffects of a bursting bubble. President George H.W. Bush and Congress created the Resolution Trust Corp. to take and sell the assets of failed thrifts. Hong Kong's free-market government went on a massive stock-buying spree in 1998, buying up shares of every company listed in the benchmark Hang Seng index. It ended up packaging them into an exchange-traded fund and making money.<br />
<br />
Today, Mr. Bernanke is taking out his playbook, said NYU economist Mr. Gertler, &quot;and rewriting it as we go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s emergency sale to Bank of America Corp. last weekend was an example of the perniciousness and unpredictability of deleveraging. In the past year, Merrill has hired a new chief executive, written off $41.4 billion in assets and raised $21 billion in equity capital.<br />
<br />
But Merrill couldn't keep up. The more it raised, the more it was forced to write off. When Merrill CEO John Thain attended a meeting with the New York Fed and other Wall Street executives last week, he saw that Merrill was the next most vulnerable brokerage firm. &quot;We watched Bear and Lehman. We knew we could be next,&quot; said one Merrill executive. Fearful that its lenders would shut the firm off, he sold to Bank of America.<br />
<br />
This crisis is complicated by innovative financial instruments that Wall Street created and distributed. They're making it harder for officials and Wall Street executives to know where the next set of risks is hiding and also contributing to the crisis's spreading impact.<br />
<br />
Swaps Game<br />
<br />
The latest trouble spot is an area called credit-default swaps, which are private contracts that let firms trade bets on whether a borrower is going to default. When a default occurs, one party pays off the other. The value of the swaps rise and fall as market reassesses the risk that a company won't be able to honor its obligations. Firms use these instruments both as insurance -- to hedge their exposures to risk -- and to wager on the health of other companies. There are now credit-default swaps on more than $62 trillion in debt, up from about $144 billion a decade ago.<br />
<br />
One of the big new players in the swaps game was AIG, the world's largest insurer and a major seller of credit-default swaps to financial institutions and companies. When the credit markets were booming, many firms bought these instruments from AIG, believing the insurance giant's strong credit ratings and large balance sheet could provide a shield against bond and loan defaults. AIG believed the risk of default was low on many securities it insured.<br />
<br />
As of June 30, an AIG unit had written credit-default swaps on more than $446 billion in credit assets, including mortgage securities, corporate loans and complex structured products. Last year, when rising subprime-mortgage delinquencies damaged the value of many securities AIG had insured, the firm was forced to book large write-downs on its derivative positions. That spooked investors, who reacted by dumping its shares, making it harder for AIG to raise the capital it increasingly needed.<br />
<br />
Credit default swaps &quot;didn't cause the problem, but they certainly exacerbated the financial crisis,&quot; says Leslie Rahl, president of Capital Market Risk Advisors, a consulting firm in New York. The sheer volumes of outstanding CDS contracts -- and the fact that they trade directly between institutions, without centralized clearing -- intertwined the fates of many large banks and brokerages.<br />
<br />
Few financial crises have been sorted out in modern times without massive government intervention. Increasingly, officials are coming to the conclusion that even more might be needed. A big problem: The Fed can and has provided short-term money to sound, but struggling, institutions that are out of favor. It can, and has, reduced the interest rates it influences to attempt to reduce borrowing costs through the economy and encourage investment and spending.<br />
<br />
But it is ill-equipped to provide the capital that financial institutions now desperately need to shore up their finances and expand lending.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Resolution Trust Scenario<br />
<br />
In normal times, capital-starved companies usually can raise money on their own. In the current crisis, a number of big Wall Street firms, including Citigroup, have turned to sovereign wealth funds, the government-controlled pools of money.<br />
<br />
But both on Wall Street and in Washington, there is increasing expectation that U.S. taxpayers will either take the bad assets off the hands of financial institutions so they can raise capital, or put taxpayer capital into the companies, as the Treasury has agreed to do with mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.<br />
<br />
One proposal was raised by Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who chairs the House Financial Services Committee. Rep. Frank is looking at whether to create an analog to the Resolution Trust Corp., which took assets from failed banks and thrifts and found buyers over several years.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you have a big loss in the marketplace, there are only three people that can take the loss -- the bondholders, the shareholders and the government,&quot; said William Seidman, who led the RTC from 1989 to 1991. &quot;That's the dance we're seeing right now. Are we going to shove this loss into the hands of the taxpayers?&quot;<br />
<br />
The RTC seemed controversial and ambitious at the time. Any analog today would be even more complex. The RTC dispensed mostly of commercial real estate. Today's troubled assets are complex debt securities -- many of which include pieces of other instruments, which in turn include pieces of others, many steps removed from the actual mortgages or consumer loans on which they are based. Unraveling these strands will be tedious and getting at the underlying collateral, difficult.<br />
<br />
In the early stages of this crisis, regulators saw that their rules didn't fit the rapidly changing financial system they were asked to oversee. Investment banks, at the core of the crisis, weren't as closely monitored by the Securities and Exchange Commission as commercial banks were by their regulators.<br />
<br />
The government has a system to close failed banks, created after the Great Depression in part to avoid sudden runs by depositors. Now, runs happen in spheres regulators may not fully understand, such as the repurchase agreement, or repo, market, in which investment banks fund their day-to-day operations. And regulators have no process for handling the failure of an investment bank like Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Insurers like AIG aren't even federally regulated.<br />
<br />
Regulators have all but promised that more banks will fail in the coming months. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is drawing up a plan to raise the premiums it charges banks so that it can rebuild the fund it uses to back deposits. Examiners are tightening their leash on banks across the country.<br />
<br />
Pleasant Mystery<br />
<br />
One pleasant mystery is why the crisis hasn't hit the economy harder -- at least so far. &quot;This financial crisis hasn't yet translated into fewer...companies starting up, less research and development, less marketing,&quot; Ivan Seidenberg, chief executive of Verizon Communications, said Wednesday. &quot;We haven't seen that yet. I'm sure every company is keeping their eyes on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
At 6.1%, the unemployment rate remains well below the peak of 7.8% in 1992, amid the S&amp;L crisis.<br />
<br />
In part, that's because government has reacted aggressively. The Fed's classic mistake that led to the Great Depression was that it tightened monetary policy when it should have eased. Mr. Bernanke didn't repeat that error. And Congress moved more swiftly to approve fiscal stimulus than most Washington veterans thought possible.<br />
<br />
In part, the broader economy has held mostly steady because exports have been so strong at just the right moment, a reminder of the global economy's importance to the U.S. And in part, it's because the U.S. economy is demonstrating impressive resilience, as information technology allows executives to react more quickly to emerging problems and -- to the discomfort of workers -- companies are quicker to adjust wages, hiring and work hours when the economy softens.<br />
<br />
But the risk remains that Wall Street's woes will spread to Main Street, as credit tightens for consumers and business. Already, U.S. auto makers have been forced to tighten the terms on their leasing programs, or abandon writing leases themselves altogether, because of problems in their finance units. Goldman Sachs economists' optimistic scenario is a couple years of mild recession or painfully slow economy growth.<br />
