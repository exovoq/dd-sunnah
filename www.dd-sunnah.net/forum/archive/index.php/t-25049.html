Fayzooz and I had a a discussion via email that started from a post of mine on a yahoo group about Shias. He was apperantly kicked out of the group for trying to defend them as it was a site for non Muslims learning Islam and new Muslims.<br />
He complained about it so I invited him here and hope he makes it through all of the Arabic buttons so he could get his voice heard in public along with the voices of Ahl Al Sunnah since he described the Sunni-Shia debate as a valid one.<br />
<br />
I sincerly hope he - who apperantly is a convert to Islam himself- makes it here so we could start the discussion.<br />
<br />
I also called onto the people responsible for this board to work on making the English section easy to use, keeping it like this has no benefit and creating an English section is NOT hard and there are many people like him who would benefit from this!<br />
For Gods sake give me access to the server and i'll make a seperate board for you in a few hours. :mad:<br />
<br />
Assalamu Alaikom</div></div><hr />
