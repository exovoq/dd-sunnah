·	July 2000: According to the National Coalition Church Burning Research Center <br />
Churches continue to burn at an average rate of over 18 per month, with 130 this year alone. Officials note that most fires are occurring in the same geographical location -- southern and mid-<br />
·	western states. They suggest that hatred of race, gender, or religion were factors in each fire<br />
National Coalition for Burned Churches  <br />
and Community Empowerment <br />
As we enter into the 21st Century, churches continue to burn on average at a rate of 15-20 per month.  As a nation of people of good will, we must redirect our focus on this issue with a new sense of urgency.  With new energy and new determination...we must send a clear message to the purveyors of hate who seek to destroy our centers of peace, hope, and sanctuary, that in the United States of America it is not acceptable to desecrate a place of  worship. <br />

<br />
Black Church Burnings: Research Report Hate Groups Hate Crimes in Nine Southern States<br />
<br />
By Center for Democratic Renewal, June 1996<br />
<br />
The Center for Democratic Renewal recognizes that the increased attack on Southern Black churches is part of a growing national trend of violent intolerance. Southern Black churches, particularly in rural areas, are the heart and soul of the Black community. That they are the target of arsonists across the South is neither random nor accidental. The links between white supremacy and attacks on Black churches have been historically documented and are well known. What has not been so obvious, except to the victims of such attacks, is that the burning of Black churches in the South has never stopped. A particularly virulent resurgence of these hate crimes has emerged over the past six years, increasing in numbers and intensity with each passing month.<br />
<br />
In some recent cases, the links between the arsonists and hate groups have been documented. In most cases the perpetrators are unknown. CDR maintains that this link is evident, whether or not a formal association exists. White supremacist ideology is the driving force behind hate rhetoric and the use of violence to threaten and intimidate. The attacks on Black churches are acts of domestic terrorism and must be placed within the context of white supremacy.<br />
<br />
The purpose of this briefing paper is to provide a glimpse into the world of hatred that exists in the states most affected by Black church burnings and bombings. This paper does not attempt to report a comprehensive list of hate groups and racially motivated incidents of violence, but instead illustrates the flavor of organized hatred in the South. This short report shows that the Klan is not dead, but is thriving. The old Klan-type of organized racism is augmented by groups with different names but motivated by the same hatred, and spewing the same intolerant rhetoric that is easily transformed, by some, into violence. The following is a partial listing of examples of hate crimes that took place in the 1990s and of organizations that existed during the same time in the nine Southern states where attacks on Black churches have taken place:<br />
<br />
Alabama<br />
<br />
Wedowee became the focus of national attention in 1994 when the high school principal, Hulond Humphries, threatened to cancel the prom if inter-racial couples planned to attend. He announced to the school that a young woman of mixed race had been a &quot;mistake.&quot; The final result of racial tensions provoked by the divided community was a school that was burned to the ground. Following close behind the racial incidents were appearances by Nathan Thomaston and his Klan from Heard County, Georgia, and Richard Barrett's Nationalist Movement.<br />
<br />
Two juveniles and one adult were arrested in April 1994 for crossburnings at a mostly white mobile home park in Florence. Police said there were no links between the crossburnings and a fire that gutted the trailer of a black family that lived there.<br />
<br />
In February 1993, A warning card from the Knights of the KKK was left on the door of a Five Points church whose membership includes blacks. In Prattville in February 1992, racial slurs, swastikas, and satanic symbols were burned into the walls and pews of a black church.<br />
<br />
After a series of violent attacks on homeless African American men, in April 1992, a black homeless man was murdered while sleeping in Birmingham by four skinhead members of the Aryan National Front and Confederate Hammerskins.<br />
<br />
In July 1991, the Chambers County Courthouse ended the 159-year-old practice of recording marriages in books marked white and colored. This happened one day after an Associated Press article was published about it.<br />
<br />
On March 31, 1990, Darren Jessie, a young black man who was dating a white woman, was shot to death while sitting in his car outside a grocery store in Mobile. A second victim was paralyzed. A white man was convicted and sentenced to life without parole.<br />
