KNOW YOUR MONEY<br />
<br />
How To Detect Counterfeit Money<br />
<br />
The public has a role in maintaining the integrity of U.S. currency. You can help guard against the threat from counterfeiters by becoming more familiar with United States currency. <br />
<br />
Look at the money you receive. Compare a suspect note with a genuine note of the same denomination and series, paying attention to the quality of printing and paper characteristics. Look for differences, not similarities. <br />
<br />

Portrait<br />
<br />
The genuine portrait appears lifelike and stands out distinctly from the background. The counterfeit portrait is usually lifeless and flat. Details merge into the background which is often too dark or mottled. <br />

Federal Reserve and Treasury Seals<br />
<br />
On a genuine bill, the saw-tooth points of the Federal Reserve and Treasury seals are clear, distinct, and sharp. The counterfeit seals may have uneven, blunt, or broken saw-tooth points. <br />

Border<br />
<br />
The fine lines in the border of a genuine bill are clear and unbroken. On the counterfeit, the lines in the outer margin and scrollwork may be blurred and indistinct. <br />
<br />

Serial Numbers<br />
<br />
Genuine serial numbers have a distinctive style and are evenly spaced. The serial numbers are printed in the same ink color as the Treasury Seal. On a counterfeit, the serial numbers may differ in color or shade of ink from the Treasury seal. The numbers may not be uniformly spaced or aligned. <br />
<br />
<br />

Paper<br />
<br />
Genuine currency paper has tiny red and blue fibers embedded throughout. Often counterfeiters try to simulate these fibers by printing tiny red and blue lines on their paper. Close inspection reveals, however, that on the counterfeit note the lines are printed on the surface, not embedded in the paper. It is illegal to reproduce the distinctive paper used in the manufacturing of United States currency. <br />

It used to be that spotting a ìgoodî counterfeit bill was impossible for ordinary people. If it was good enough to pass the ìlook and feelî test, then it was going to take an ultra-violet light or a magnetic ink detector. But for the past ten years, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing has been making bills that are easy to check.<br />
The amount of counterfeit money in the US is low enough that most people feel safe taking money with barely a minimal check for counterfeits. Does it look and feel like money? Then it probably is. But have you ever gotten a bill where somethingóeither the bank note or the person giving it to you (http://www.divinecaroline.com/22189/55640-possible-spot-liar-)óseemed a little off? Ever wished you could quickly check to see if it was good? Well, hereís how.<br />
http://media.divinecaroline.com.s3.amazonaws.com/ext/article_images2/misc/50_dollar_bill.jpg <br />
Step 1) Look and Feel<br />
This is as far as most people go, and itís good enough most of the time. US bank notes are printed on special paper thatís 75 percent cotton and 25 percent linen. The linen gives it an extra stiffness thatís distinctive. There are also red and blue fibers imbedded in the paper. Bank notes are printed with a process called ìintaglioî that leaves ink on top of the paper, giving the money a distinctive texture. The printing is also very high quality, so the lines are sharp and clear, not broken, fuzzy, or blobby.<br />
Step 2) Color-Shifting Ink<br />
Bank notes bigger than the $5 bill use color-shifting ink to print the number showing the denomination in the lower-right-hand corner. Just look at the numbers head-on, and then from an angle. For genuine notes the color will shift (copper-to-green (http://www.divinecaroline.com/22287/76281-) or green-to-black).<br />
You can get this far pretty discreetly. The look and feel youíre checking automatically as soon as the bill is handed to you, and you can confirm the color-shifting ink in a quick glance. Going further will require that you hold the note up to the light, which is basically saying that you think you might have gotten counterfeit money. A lot of people hesitate to do that, but itís the next step if you want to be sure.<br />
Step 3) Watermark<br />
All bills bigger than a $2 now have a watermark; hold the bill up to the light to see it. For the $10, $20, $50, and $100, the image matches the portrait. You can use the watermark to spot bills that have been bleached and reprinted with a higher denomination. The watermark is part of the paper and is visible from the rear of the note as well.<br />
Step 4) Security Thread<br />
All bills bigger than a $2 have a security thread running vertically through the bill. Like the watermark, you hold the bill up to the light to see it. The thread has text with the billís denomination and an image that is unique to that denomination. The different denominations have the threads in different places, again so you can spot bills that have been bleached and reprinted with a higher denomination. (The threads also glow different colors under ultraviolet light, but thatís not much help to ordinary folks.)</div></div><hr />
