<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ÊÂ«»Ì Õ‰Ì›</div><div class="date">13-11-06, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Polygamy is an issue that is conversed a lot in the world especially these days, where everyday we see women on television holding those posters claiming there legal rights. I personally have no claim against women rights, they deserve to be treated well like the poet once said ìwomen are roses, and we men love those roses.î People claiming that Islam has disgraced the ethical and morals by allowing polygamy practice. I believe that Islam has saved the balance of the society and reserved the women rights by allowing polygamy. Even though polygamy is a controversial issue and have many opposes to it, it has many bright sides of it, when we observe it from different angles, such as giving the divorced women a new chance in their lives , creating a  healthy society where a woman can trust her man.<br />
<br />
<br />
          One of the issues about polygamy that people argue about now is that Islam made polygamy from their own, and what really hurts what some people said about Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) that he loves women and he made this legal for his own pleasure. This is just a big lie if we looked in to the history of Islam we will find out that his wives were all married before, and he married one young woman only which is Aisha, the rest were married before. The real question is did Islam came up with polygamy or its there since ages? The answer is that polygamy is there from a longtime ago. King salmon (who is also a prophet) had a hundreds of  wives like what is said in the bible : ìKing Solomon, however, loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh's daughteróMoabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites.î2 (1 Kings 11:1-2). ìHe had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray. (1 Kings 11:3)  This shows thatís polygamy is mentioned in the Bible before the Quran. One might say, but men take advantage of women by this marriage, this is not true, because the Quran has preserved women rights in polygamy, for instance men canít marry other women unless there is a good reason for that, with his wife approval, and he must treat his wives equally. Someone might say that this is not true not everyone is doing that, ill say its true but we canít judge peopleís acts against the Quran and blame the Quran thatís not fair not everyone is good.<br />
<br />
<br />
	The quran as I mentioned earlier had polygamy marriage for a good cause, it had a solution to different problems and not everyone must practice polygamy. If you read the Quran you will find that there is no forcing of practicing polygamy instead it was put as a solution to problems. Imagine with me that a man wants to have a kid but his wife for a certain disease couldnít have a kid. What should this man do? People would say will maybe its better to adapt a child , will we all are humans and we know there is a huge difference between a child from your flesh and child from someone elseís flesh . Should this man cheat on his wife to have a baby? Polygamy here interferes to become a solution to all that , at least  the man will have a chance to have a child , the women will also have  the right to act with or against this act  at least she knows what her husband is doing , this also implies to men whom have  more need than other men in speaking of sexual needs , they can have two wives instead of playing and fooling around with a cheap women  behind his wives back.<br />
<br />
Another good reason about polygamy is that women have another chance to go on with there lives, women nowadays receives a very harsh treatment from men on the least thing they make a divorce and the women must raise the children maybe four or five and her work is not that good financially. This would be a big problem for the wife physically and mentally. She will work double as before because she will serve as a mother and a father, why canít someone marry her just for the cause of helping her and taking care of her children with her. People would argue and say but marriage is love, I agree with that but what comes after love? Love is just emotions it can be replaced easily , what comes after love is respect and care and this you can find in any women by time after knowing her , love is just the first step to care and respect , people always concentrate about love they should be more rational.<br />
<br />
In conclusion Polygamy is a type of marriage that has been there before Islam, its cause was to be a solution to both men and women by also reserving their rights.</div></div><hr />

Women treatment from the Bible:<br />
( Exodus 21:7: )A male slave is given his freedom after 6 years; but a female slave remained a slave forever.<br />
<br />
<br />
( 1Co:11:5: ) But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven. 1Co:11:6: For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.<br />
<br />
<br />
Polygamy in the Bible: <br />
(Dt:21:15: 15. ) ( king James version )  If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated<br />
<br />
At the end why should  we start pointing at people if we have the same problem , that  if  it is a problem &#8230;.. ?<br />
