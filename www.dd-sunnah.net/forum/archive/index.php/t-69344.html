From the Quran<br />
&quot;And yet there are some people,<br />
who replace God with rivals,<br />
loving them as God is loved.<br />
But the believers love God more intensely&quot;<br />
(2:165)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It was made attractive to people,<br />
the love of things they crave;<br />
women, sons, heaped-up heaps of gold and silver,<br />
branded horses, cattle and will-tilled land.<br />
But that is for the enjoyment of this worldly life,<br />
But God, with Him is the beautiful homecoming&quot;<br />
(3:14)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Say: If you love<br />
your fathers, your sons, your brothers,<br />
your spouses, your family ties,<br />
the wealth you have gained,<br />
the business you fear would decline, and<br />
the dwellings of which you are fond,<br />
more than you love God,<br />
His messenger and<br />
striving for God's cause (Jehad),<br />
then wait until God<br />
brings about His decision,<br />
as God does not guide<br />
those who are ungodly&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
God loves:<br />
<br />
those who do good deeds (2:195)<br />
those who ask Him for forgiveness (2:222)<br />
those who purify themselves (2:222)<br />
those who are God-fearing (3:76)<br />
those who are steadfast (3:146)<br />
those who trust Him (3:159)<br />
those who act justly (5:42)<br />
those who strive for His cause (61:4)<br />
those who follow His Prophet (3:31)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
God does not love:<br />
<br />
the aggressors (2:190)<br />
the disbelievers (3:32)<br />
those who inflict injustice (3:57)<br />
evil (5:64) and evil doers (2:205)<br />
those who are arrogant (4:36)<br />
those who spend lavishly (6:141)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You will not attain righteousness,<br />
unless you give of that which you love&quot; (3:92)<br />
&quot;They (the disbelievers) love this worldly life<br />
more than the Hereafter&quot; (16:107)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;O you believe ..<br />
God has made you love the Faith,<br />
and made it so beautiful in your hearts,<br />
and has made you hate disbelief,<br />
immorality and rebelliousness.<br />
These are the righteous.<br />
This is grace and bounty,<br />
from God, as God is All-knowledgeable<br />
and All-Wise&quot; (49:6-8)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Say (O Mohammed) &quot;If you do love God,<br />
follow me,<br />
God will love you,<br />
and forgive your sins,<br />
as God is All-Forgiving, All-Merciful&quot;. (3:31)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;O you believe ..<br />
Do not you love that God<br />
Would forgive you?&quot; (24:22)<br />
<br />

<br />
From the Hadith<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;God Almighty said: If My servant loves to meet<br />
Me, I love to meet him, and if he hates to meet<br />
Me, I hate to meet him.&quot; (narrated by Bukhari)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;God loves kindness when you deal with any<br />
matter&quot; (narrated by Bukhari and Muslim)<br />
&quot;You will not enter Paradise until you have faith<br />
and you will not have faith until you love one<br />
another. Do you want me to tell you<br />
something you can do to make you love one<br />
another? Make it a habit to greet one another<br />
with &quot;Asalamu Alaykum&quot; - peace upon you&quot;.<br />
(narrated by Muslim)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Give gifts to each other, as this will make you<br />
love one another.&quot; (narrated by Muslim)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The most loved person by God Almighty on the<br />
Day of Judgement and nearest to Him is a just<br />
ruler. And the most hated person by God<br />
Almighty on the Day of Judgement and farthest<br />
from Him is an unjust ruler.&quot;<br />
(narrated by Tirmizi)<br />
&quot;If a Muslim loves his Muslim brother, he should<br />
inform him.&quot; (narrated by Tirmizi)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
God would say on the Day of Judgement:<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are those who love each other for the sake of My glory? Today I will shelter them with My shade, as there is no shade today except My shade&quot;.&quot; (narrated by Muslim)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;God Almighty said: &quot;My servant draws near to Me with nothing more loved by Me than the acts of worship that I have enjoined upon him. My servant continues to try to draw near to Me with more devotion, until I love him. When I love him, I will be his hearing with which he hears, his sight by which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, his feet on which he walks. When he asks Me for something, I will respond and when he takes refuge in Me, I will grant it to him. I do not hesitate in doing anything I intend to do as much as I hesitate in seizing the soul of My faithful servant; he hates death and I hate hurting him. But death is a must for him&quot;.&quot;<br />
(narrated by Bukhari)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;If God would love his servant He would call Archangel Gabriel and tell him &quot;I love this person, therefore love him.&quot; And Gabriel would love him and call out in the heavens &quot;God loves this person, therefore love him.&quot; And the inhabitants of the heavens would love him. Then he would be embraced by the people of this world. But if God would abhor his servant, He would call Gabriel and tell him &quot;I abhor this person, therefore abhor him&quot;. And Gabriel would abhor him and call out in the heavens &quot; God abhors this person, therefore abhor him.&quot; And the inhabitants of the heavens would abhor him. Then he would be abhorred by the people of this world.&quot; (narrated by Muslim)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;God Almighty said &quot;I am as My servant expects Me to be. I am with him if he remembers Me. If he remembers Me to himself, I would remember him to Myself. And if he remembers Me in a gathering, I would remember him in a gathering, which is even better. And if My servant draws near to Me by a hand's span, I would draw near to him by an arm's length and if he draws near to Me by an arm's length, I would draw near to him by a fathom's length. And if My servant comes to me walking, I would go to him speeding.&quot; (narrated by Bukhari)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;A strong believer is better and more loved by God Almighty than a weak believer, although both bear goodness. Thus, seek eagerly what benefits you the most and seek God's help. Do not show weakness in your struggle and if something bad happens to you, do not say &quot;if I had done so and so, then such and such would not have happened&quot;, but say &quot;it was my destiny and God has allowed what He wished&quot; , because the word 'if' in this context would open the door for Satan to work on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;A man came to the Prophet (may God's peace and blessings be upon him) and asked him &quot;O God's Messenger, tell me of something I do to win God's love and people's love&quot;. The Prophet answered &quot;Do not love this world, God would love you and do not have a longing for whatever people have, people would love you&quot;.<br />
(narrated by Ibn-Majah)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Visit one another from time to time, your love for each other will increase.&quot;<br />
(narrated by al Bazzar)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;None of you will truly believe until you love for your brother what you love for yourself&quot;.<br />
(narrated by Bukhari)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoever loves for God's sake, hates for God's sake, gives for God's sake and withholds for God's sake has a perfect faith.&quot;<br />
(narrated by Abo Dawood)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;There are three characteristics whoever has them will taste the sweetness of faith: that God and His Messenger are more loved by him than everything else, that he loves or does not love a person only for God's sake and that he would hate to revert into disbelief just as he would hate to be thrown into fire.&quot; (narrated by Bukhari)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;There are seven whom God will shade with His shade on the Day when there is no shade except His; a just ruler, a youth who grew up in the worship of His Lord, a man whose heart is attached to mosques, two men who love each other only for God's sake, meeting and parting for that love, a man who resists the call of a woman of noble birth and beauty to commit fornication, but he refuses and says &quot;I fear God&quot;, a man who gives charity secretly so that his left hand does not know what his right hand has given and a man whose eyes flood with tears whenever he remembers God in private.&quot;<br />
(narrated by Bukhari)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;When a man asked the prophet, may God's peace and blessings be upon him, &quot;O Messenger of God, when will the Day of Judgement be?&quot;, the Prophet replied, &quot;What have you prepared for it?&quot; he said, &quot;I have not prepared for it a great deal of prayer, fasting nor charity, but I love God and His Messenger intensely,&quot; the Prophet said, &quot;You will be with those whom you love.&quot;<br />
(narrated by Bukhari) <br />
