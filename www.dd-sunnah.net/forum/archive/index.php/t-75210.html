<br />
Yes. The word in Hebrew came from &quot;El&quot; and in Arabic from &quot;Elh&quot;. The word for &quot;god&quot; (note the small 'g' in English) is &quot;Elah&quot;. Compare this to &quot;Eloi&quot; and &quot;Eli&quot; in the New Testament.<br />
<br />
The word &quot;Allah&quot; is the perfect word to describe the God of Jews and Christians as it does not permit gender nor plural. Therefore, when the word is used as in &quot;Eloihim&quot; or &quot;Allahumma&quot; (these would appear at first to be plural and/or female genders) it becomes clear it is the royal usage such as a king would use in referring to his royal station while make a decree of some type. The king would state, &quot;We decree the following...&quot; and he is actually talking about his royal position rather than plural status.<br />
<br />
There is no word in English for the &quot;God&quot; of Israel, the &quot;God&quot; of Jesus. This explains why the spelling remains the same whether speaking of a false &quot;god&quot; or pagan idol and the &quot;God&quot; of Abraham or Moses or Jesus (peace be upon them). Note the use of the capital &quot;g&quot; (G). This is the only way English can present a difference between the two. In the semitic languages it is easy to distinguish the difference between a &quot;god&quot; and &quot;The God&quot; due to the structure of the word itself.<br />
<br />
Evidence for this is quite simple. Visit any motel or hotel and remove the Bible located in the drawer next to the bed (placed they courtesy of the Gideon Society). Note inside the first few pages a reference to the translations of the Bible they have made into 27 languages. The second example they give is to the Arabic language of the passage in the New Testament from the Gospel of John 3:16. The verse begins in English; &quot;For God so loved the world..&quot; and in the Arabic translation the word used for &quot;God&quot; is &quot;Allah.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Arabic Bible beginning with the Book of Genesis uses the word &quot;Allah&quot; to represent &quot;The God&quot; of Creation; Adam and Eve; Noah; Abraham; Ishmael and Isaac and Israel. Page one of Genesis has the word &quot;Allah&quot; 17 times. <br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Misconception #1: Muslims worship a different God<br />
<br />
First of all, there is only One God who created the Universe and all of mankind. Throughout history, people have created false gods in their minds and come up with false ideas about Almighty God, but regardless of this there is still only One True God - and He alone is worthy of worship. Unfortunately, some non-Muslims have come to incorrectly believe that Muslims worship a different God than Jews and Christians. This might be due to the fact that Muslims sometimes refer to God as &quot;Allah&quot;, but also because over the centuries there have been many lies and distortions spread by the enemies of Islam. In actuality, Muslims worship the God of Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus --- the same God as Christians and Jews. The word &quot;Allah&quot; is simply the Arabic word for Almighty God and it is the same word that Arabic speaking Christians and Jews use to refer to God. If you pick up an Arabic translation of the Christian Bible, you will see the word &quot;Allah&quot; where &quot;God&quot; is used in English. For more information on the word &quot;Allah&quot;, please read: Who is Allah? But even though Muslims, Jews and Christians believe in the same God, their concepts about Him differ quite a bit. For example, Muslims reject the idea of the Trinity or that God has become &quot;incarnate&quot; in the world. Also, the teachings of Islam do not rely on or appeal to &quot;mystery&quot; or &quot;paradox&quot; --- they are straightforward and clear. Islam teaches that God is Merciful, Loving and Compassionate and that He has no need to become man (nor do humans need for Him to). One of the unique aspects of Islam is that it teaches that man can have a personal and fulfilling relationship with Almighty God without compromising the transcendence of God. In Islam there is no ambiguity in Divinity --- God is God and man is man. Muslims believe that God is the &quot;Most Merciful&quot;, and that he deals directly with human-beings without the need of any intermediary. Actually, the phrase &quot;In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful&quot; is one of the most repeated verses in the Holy Qur'an. Additionally, the pure and straightforward teachings of Islam demand that Almighty God be approached directly and without intermediaries. This is because Muslims believe that God is completely in control of everything and that He can bestow His Grace and Mercy on His creatures as He pleases - no Atonement, Incarnation or blood sacrifice is necessary. In summary, Islam calls people to submit to the One True God and to worship Him alone. <br />
