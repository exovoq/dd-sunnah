<br />
1.	He was the head of the transgressing group:<br />
<br />
As for being the head of the transgressing group then this does not <br />
justify cursing him, rather Allah -subhanahu wa tala- said: &quot;If two <br />
parties among the Believers fall into a quarrel, make ye peace <br />
between them: but if one of them transgresses beyond bounds against <br />
the other, then fight against the one that transgresses until it <br />
complies with the Command of Allah; but if it complies, then make <br />
peace between them with justice, and be fair: for Allah loves those <br />
who are just. The Believers are but a single Brotherhood: so make <br />
peace and reconciliation between your two brothers; and fear Allah, <br />
that ye may receive Mercy.&quot; [49:9]<br />
<br />
So they are still brothers and they are still Muslims.<br />
<br />
And the Prophet ñsala Allahu Alyhi wa Salaam- said regarding Al-<br />
Hassan ñ Radia Allahu Anhu-: &quot;This son of mine is a chief, and Allah <br />
may make peace between two groups of Muslims through him.&quot; <br />
<br />
Again still Muslims.<br />
<br />
And the Prophet ñ sala Allahu Alyhi Wa Salaam- said regarding the <br />
Khawarij:&quot; &quot;An arrow will penetrate a group of the muslims. They will <br />
be killed by the group closest to the truth.&quot;<br />
<br />
He had it clear that each group was connected to the truth. However, <br />
the party of `Ali ñRadia Allah Anhu- was closer to it. <br />
<br />
According to Nahj Al-Balagha, it was not the intent of Ameer-ul <br />
Momineen to make abusers out of his followers, when he heard that <br />
some insulted the army of Sham he is reported to have said: &quot;I <br />
dislike that you would be regular abusers, but if you describe their <br />
deeds and recount their situations that would be a better mode of <br />
speaking and a more convincing way of arguing. Instead of abusing <br />
them you should say, &quot;O' Allah! save our blood and their blood, <br />
produce reconciliation between us and them, and lead them out of <br />
their misguidance so that he who is ignorant of the truth may know <br />
it, and he who inclines towards rebellion and revolt may turn away <br />
from it.&quot;<br />
<br />
2.	Even the prophet(S) himself has cursed him. See for <br />
example:<br />
<br />
 Ibn 'Abbas, said: &quot;We were on a journey with the Prophet<br />
of Allah (S.A.W.) when he heard two men singing, one of them<br />
responding to the other. Whereupon the Prophet (S.A.W.) said: 'Seewho they are'. The people said: 'Mu'awiya and 'Amr b. al-'As'. The Prophet of Allah raised his hands and said: 'O Allah! Debase them and confine them into the fire'&quot;. References:<br />
<br />
Musnad Ahmad V4 p421<br />
Tabarani in Al Mu'jam Al-Kabir<br />
<br />
Imam Ahmad, Abu Yala, and Al-Bazar have all narrated this hadith from <br />
the narration of the companion Abu Barza Al-Aslami with the two men <br />
singing unidentified. Al-Tabarani narrated it in Al-Awsat from the <br />
narration of Al-Mutallib Ibn Rabia and also here the two men are not <br />
identified. The only place were they are identified is in the <br />
narration of Ibn Abbas in Al-Tabarani's Al-Mujam Al-Kabir, through a <br />
man called &quot; Essa Ibn Sawada' Al-Nakhai&quot; whom Al-Haythami has <br />
declared as a liar. Sawada' narrated this hadith from Sulayman Ibn <br />
Amr' Ibn Al-Ahwas, the very same narrator who narrated the hadith <br />
through Abu Barza (NOT ibn Abbas) with the two men NOT identified. <br />
This being said, Sulayman's integrity in relating hadiths is not <br />
known, and the other narrator from him, Yazid Ibn Abi Ziyad is weak. <br />
Either way the hadith is not reliable, rather the Prophet ñpbuh- <br />
prayed for Muwayia that Allah would teach him the Book and protect <br />
him from the Fire, as narrated by three companions: Al-Erbadh, Abdul-Rahman Ibn Abi Umaira, and Maslamah Ibn Mukhlid [Narrated by Ahmad in Fada'l Al-Sahabah, Al-Tabarani, Bukhari in Tareekh]. Also in some of the narrations, that the singing is with regards to the Muslim casualties of Uhud, so it would not make sense that Ibn Abbas ñRadia Allahu Anhu- would say: We were on a journey with the Prophet etc, since this will make Ibn Abbas barely a six ñ year ñ old and it is known that the Prophet ñpbuh- has returned much older youths than <br />
this age such as Ibn Umar, Abu Saeed, Zayed ibn Arqam, Zayed Ibn <br />
Thabit from the battle for being of a young age (i.e 13 years old).<br />
<br />
3.	On the authority of Abu Dharr al-Ghifari, who said to Mu'awiya: &quot;I heard the Prophet of Allah say when you passed by him: 'O Allah! Curse him and make his stomach full of nothing but dust!'&quot;<br />
<br />
References:<br />
<br />
Musnad Ahmad V4 p421<br />
Lisanul 'Arab V7 p404<br />
<br />
I wonder if (Musnad Ahmad V4 p 421) is a typo for two <br />
reasons: (1) The earlier hadith is from the narration of Abu Barza Al-<br />
Aslami and this one is from the narration of Abu Dhar and it is <br />
impossible that they are listed on the same page in Musnad Ahmad <br />
since obviously they are for two different narrators and the hadiths <br />
of Abu Dhar run from 20328 to 20593 while those of Abu Barza run from <br />
18927 to 18975 so obviously one cannot fit 1384 hadiths on one <br />
page !!!! (2) I could not find this hadith anywhere in Musnad Ahmad. <br />
And as anyone would know Lisan Al-Arab is not a source of hadith <br />
narrations.<br />
<br />
Finally, the Rafidites cannot justify any reason for cursing a companion of the Prophet -sala Allahu Alyhi Wa Salaam-:<br />
<br />
Allah -Tala- said: &quot; &quot;And those who came after them say: &quot;Our Lord! Forgive us, and our <br />
brethren who came before us into the Faith, and leave not, in our <br />
hearts, rancour against those who have believed. Our Lord! Thou art <br />
indeed Full of Kindness, Most Merciful.&quot; [59:10]<br />
<br />
The Prophet -sala Allahu Alyhi Wa Salaam- said: ìWhoever insults my companions, then may the curse of Allah, His angels, and the whole of humanity be on him.&quot;</div></div><hr />
