 <br />
 <br />
<br />
People who do not follow any religion sometimes ask, ìWhy would God order me to worship Him when He is not in need of my worship?î the answer is to this is quite simple; He doesnít need your worship. You need to worship Him for your own benefit. <br />
<br />
Take the example of a manned mission to mars. Letís say that NASA is concerned about a long journey in space leads to bone loss. Unless some measures are taken, the astronautsí bones will be so fragile that they run the risk of fracture when they reach mars. So NASA prescribes some daily exercises designed to strengthen their bones. They also know that when the astronauts arrive at their destination they will face an atmosphere with less oxygen than that of the earth. So NASA provides the astronauts with a supply of pills that will boost their hemoglobin. They are ordered to take these pills five times a day without fail. After a month in space, one of the astronauts gets lazy. His stats to complain, ìWhy must we do these exercises? And what skin will it be off NASAís nose if I donít take these pills? îOf course, it is no skin off NASAís nose. The astronaut who fails to follow NASAís instructions will simply fail to survive when he reaches the destination. The destination of the human being is the hereafter. If he has not developed the traits needed to survive there he will find himself unable to live yet unable to die. That is, he will remain alive only in the sense that he (or she) will be able to experience pain vividly.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Deists also frequently claim, ìI donít hurt anyone. I mind my own business and try to do well, and I donít need a religion to make me good. ìThis attitude has a number of problems. First of all, how do you determine what is good? Without the objective criteria provided by revelation, you will decide what is good or evil based on what you think and feel. Your idea of evil may be someone elseís idea of good, and vice versa.<br />
 <br />
<br />
The other problem with this attitude may be clarified by the following example. A certain teenager is a hard-working, straight-A student. He is polite to his teachers. He has a good sense of humor and is popular with his classmates. He sometimes skips lunch and gibes his money to needier students. He helps little old ladies to cross busy intersections. But when he comes home, he does not greet his parents. If they greet him, he doesnít respond. He goes to the fridge, makes himself a sandwich and disappears into his room, where he locks the door, does his homework and watches TV until itís time to go to bed. In the morning he gets dressed and leaves the house without even acknowledging the existence of his parents. <br />
 <br />
<br />
Would you call such a person good? His relationships with everyone are very good, except for his relationship with the most important people in his life. He is estranged from those to whom he owes the most, the ones who are the immediate cause of his existence, the ones who went to great trouble to support him and continue to support him despite his shabby treatment of them. To Allah belongs the highest similitude. A person owes more to Allah than he does to his parents. One who lives his life without acknowledging Godís exclusive right to be worshipped is a person whose life is seriously out of balance.<br />
