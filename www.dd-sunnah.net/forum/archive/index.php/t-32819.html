<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">«·√⁄‘Ï</div><div class="date">21-07-04, 04:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shiekh Al-Sadhan mentioned in his book (Ma'alim fe Tareeq Talab Al-Elm) pg. 250-251 to the effect that:<br />
<br />
And I will mention here three things that are related to one of the companions may Allah be please with them (Radia Allahu Anhum) because we have been inflicted with it in some of the books and magazines, even in school books, and these three things are related to Ali -RA-. One notices in what is read and heared that whenever Ali - RA- is mentioned three labels are associated with him: either the term &quot;Imam Ali&quot; is used or &quot;Karama Allahu Wajhahu&quot; (meaning May Allah honour his face) or Ali -AS-. These labels contain exaggerations and scholars of knowledge - such as Ibn Katheer and others- have specifically mentioned that it is not permissible to use them specifically fo Ali and not the other companions - May Allah be pleased with all of them- because Abu Bakhr, Omar and Uthman are better than him - RA-.<br />
<br />
Ibn Kathir said: &quot; And this expression is used be many a scribe, that one would use only for Ali to say: &quot;Alyhi Assalam&quot; and not for the other companions or &quot; Karama Allahu Wajhahu&quot; and even though these expressions have a correct meaning , but one has to treat all companions evenly in this matter, for these expression are used for reverence and respect, and the two Shiekhs (i.e Abu Bakr and Omar) and Ameer-ul-Momineen Uthman are more worthy of such titles - may Allah be pleased with them all-) Tafseer Ibn Katheer (3/539)<br />
<br />
And those who use &quot; Karama Allahu Wajhahu&quot; specifically for Ali - RA- claim that he never prostrated to an idol, and this reasoning is flawed since some companions have been born Muslims such as the young among the companions. It has even been confirmed that Abu Bakr, and others, have never prostrated to idols. Hence, Ali -RA- is not singled out from amongst other companions to have this attribute. Some scholars , such as Al-Haytami in his Fatawa, have declared it permissible but this sayings has been refuted as previously qouted from Ibn Kathir -Rahimahu Allah-.<br />
<br />
As for using the title of Imam, then as mentioned earlier it contains a scent of exaggeration, because those who use this title to do not apply it to Abu Bakr or Omar or Uthman and it might as well be , for some, an indication of shiasm for they see that the only person eligible for Imamah is Ali and none other. And a similar thing can be said with the expression &quot;Alyhi Assalam&quot;<br />
<br />
So (dear brothers and sisters) be careful of these expressions and show its error to whoever reads or hears it</div></div><hr />
