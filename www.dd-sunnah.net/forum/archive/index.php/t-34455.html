Vatican Warns About Zen, Yoga<br />
<br />
<br />
   VATICAN CITY (AP) - The Vatican Thursday cautioned Roman Catholics that<br />
Eastern meditation practices such as Zen and yoga can ``degenerate into a cult<br />
of the body'' that debases Christian prayer.<br />
<br />
   ``The love of God, the sole object of Christian contemplation, is a reality<br />
which cannot be `mastered' by any method or technique,'' said a document<br />
issued by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.<br />
<br />
   The document, approved by Pope John Paul II and addressed to bishops, said<br />
attempts to combine Christian meditation with Eastern techniques were fraught<br />
with danger although they can have positive uses.<br />
<br />
   The 23-page document, signed by the West German congregation head Cardinal<br />
Joseph Ratzinger, was believed the first time the Vatican sought to respond to<br />
the pull of Eastern religious practices.<br />
<br />
   Ratzinger told a news conference that the document was not condemning<br />
Eastern meditation practices, but was elaborating on guidelines for proper<br />
Christian prayer.<br />
<br />
	By Eastern methods, the document said, it was referring to practices<br />
inspired by Hinduism and Buddhism such as Zen, Transcendental Meditation and<br />
yoga, which [may] involve prescribed postures and controlled breathing.<br />
<br />
   Some Christians, ``caught up in the movement toward openness and exchanges<br />
between various religions and cultures, are of the opinion that their prayer<br />
has much to gain from these methods,'' the document said.<br />
<br />
   But, it said, such practices ``can degenerate into a cult of the body and<br />
can lead surreptitiously to considering all bodily sensations as spiritual<br />
experiences.''<br />
<br />
   The document defined Christian prayer as a ``personal, intimate and<br />
profound dialogue between man and God.''<br />
<br />
   Such prayer ``flees from impersonal techniques or from concentrating on<br />
oneself, which can create a kind of rut, imprisoning the person praying in a<br />
spiritual privatism.''<br />
<br />
   Attempts to combine Christian and non-Christian mediation are ``not free<br />
from dangers and errors,'' the document said.<br />
<br />
   It expressed particular concern over misconceptions about body postures in<br />
meditation.<br />
<br />
   ``Some physical exercises automatically produce a feeling of quiet and<br />
relaxation, pleasing sensations, perhaps even phenomena of light and of<br />
warmth, which resemble spiritual well-being. To take such feelings for the<br />
authentic consolations of the Holy Spirit would be a totally erroneous way of<br />
conceiving the spiritual life.<br />
<br />
   ``Giving them a symbolic significance typical of the mystical experience,<br />
when the moral condition of the person concerned does not correspond to such<br />
an experience, would represent a kind of mental schizophrenia which could also<br />
lead to psychic disturbance and, at times, to moral deviations.''<br />
<br />
   The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith is the Vatican's watchdog<br />
body for doctrinal orthodoxy. The document did not name any particular<br />
individuals, groups or religious movements that have strayed in the use of<br />
Eastern meditation practices but the congregation often acts in response to<br />
complaints.<br />

Vatican summit aims to combat threat of 'alternative' religions <br />
by Peter Popham - Indepenent Wednesday, Jun 16 2004, 9:02pm<br />
international / miscellaneous / news report <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Christianity, and particularly Catholocism often come under a lot of fire from Pagans, for the most it seems Catholics barely notice. I spend a lot of time defending them to people, showing that they're not all bad.. the Chruch of the modern era has a long way to go though. - NotSoWise|Sage<br />
Catholics from more than 25 countries are in Rome this week to hammer out a strategy for combating the threat posed to Christianity by &quot;New Age&quot; religions and fads.<br />
<br />
&quot;Astrologers believe that the Age of Pisces - known to them as the Christian age - is drawing to a close,&quot; explained an exhaustive report on the New Age produced by the Catholic church last year. And as priests around the world watch their congregations dwindle through boredom or plain disbelief, the Church believes that the moment has come to fight back.<br />
<br />
Monsignor Peter Fleetwood, one of the authors of the report, said those at the closed-door conference include priests and lay people from Latin America &quot;worried that they can be pushed out by something that has come from abroad&quot;, and from Asia where &quot;a lot of traditional religions are reviving&quot;.<br />
<br />
But for Fleetwood the greatest challenge may be in England and North America, &quot;where the New Age began ... and where it has become such a part of everyday life that we don't notice it&quot;. That makes it harder to attack, he says: &quot;Where one sees a threat, it's easier to battle it.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is an enemy with dozens of heads: the version of the Jewish kabbalah espoused by Madonna, the Enneagram personality-reading cult, ancient Egyptian occult practices, Sufism, the lore of the Druids, Celtic Christianity, medieval alchemy, Renaissance hermeticism, Yoga, Zen Buddhism, and many more.<br />
<br />
The report acknowledges the strength of the Enemy Within: &quot;In Western culture in particular, the appeal of 'alternative' approaches to spirituality is very strong .... New forms of psychological affirmation of the individual have become very popular among Catholics.&quot;<br />
<br />
Under the liberal dispensation of Pope John XXIII and the Second Vatican Council, Catholic missionaries explored the religious traditions of lands where in the past their task would have been restricted to converting the heathen.<br />
<br />
In Japan, one Jesuit missionary became a Zen Buddhist roshi (&quot;master&quot;). He in fact became a reverse missionary, implanting Zen Buddhist ideas and practice in Catholic groups in Germany and elsewhere, where they continue to thrive.<br />
<br />
But Pope John Paul II's church is far less tolerant about practices that the Pope's &quot;enforcer of the faith&quot;, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, dismissed as &quot;spiritual auto-eroticism&quot;.<br />
<br />
New Age is getting a grip on Christians because many are failing to find authentic spirituality in the Church. They are failing to find, as the report put it, &quot;the importance of man's spiritual dimension and its integration with the whole of life, the search for life's meaning, the link between human beings and the rest of creation, the desire for personal and social transformation, and the rejection of a rationalistic and materialistic view of humanity.&quot;<br />
<br />
While one of the two &quot;pontifical councils&quot; involved in taking up the challenge is that for &quot;inter-religious dialogue&quot;, suggesting that the New Agers be dealt with on a similar footing to Muslims, Jews, and indeed Anglicans, the Pope himself appears to see the issue as a simple matter of right and wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;We cannot delude ourselves,&quot; he says, that &quot;this return of ancient Gnostic ideas&quot; &quot;will lead toward a renewal of religion.&quot; It is, he said, &quot;a way of distorting His Word ... in distinct, if not declared, conflict with all that is essentially Christian&quot;.<br />
<br />
The time for a decisive battle is clearly fast approaching. And the message to faithful in the report is plain: quit &quot;shopping around in the world's fair of religious proposals.&quot;<br />
