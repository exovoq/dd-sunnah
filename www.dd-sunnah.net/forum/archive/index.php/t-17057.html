  Friday Prayer, Why is it not Wajib?<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 Salam Alaikum..<br />
<br />
I asked this question a while back but didnt get satisfactory replies. I was wondering why we Ithna-Ashari Shia's find the Friday prayer as a Mustahab task and not Wajib? Why is it only Wajib during the leadership of an Infallible Imam? The quran clearly defines it yet there is no mention of making it Mustahab and not Wajib.<br />
<br />
Any feedback would be greatly appriciated. Thanks. <br />

Friday prayer will be wajib when Imam (AS) reappears and establishes his government. Ayatollah Khamenei has this to say about it:<br />
<br />
Friday [Jumuíah] Prayers<br />
<br />
Question 616: What is your opinion regarding oneís participation in Friday prayers? During this period of time when the Twelfth Imam is in occultation, is it obligatory or not on some to attend Friday prayers when they do not believe the Friday prayers leader to be adil?<br />
<br />
A: Today, even though Friday prayers is considered a takhyiri [selective] obligation [an obligatory duty which is fulfilled by the performance of one of two specified duties ] during this period of time and it is not considered obligatory on people to participate in it, one should not deprive oneself of the blessings of the prayers solely due to doubt in the adalah of the imam or due to irrelevant excuses.<br />
<br />
.................................................. ................... end :confused:<br />
<br />
and Allah Talaa said in surah Al-Juma, ayah 9 &quot; O ye who believe! When the call is proclaimed to prayer on Friday (the Day of Assembly), hasten earnestly to the Remembrance of Allah, and leave off business (and traffic): That is best for you if ye but knew! &quot;<br />
<br />
some thing strange is not it :confused:<br />
<br />
evrey things are clear in the Holy Quraan, from this ayah Allah Talaa said &quot; leave off business &quot; and it means an order from Allah Talla, how they said it will be wajib until their imam apear?</div></div><hr />

ctually there is something funnier than that, which is the narration that basically says, those among shi'ites who pray, their prayers cover for those who do not pray, and those who pay zakat cover for those who do not pay zakat etc<br />
<br />
So if you are a shi'a (God Forbid) and you feel lazy or tired to get up and perform Salat (prayer) don't yuh worry, 'cuz someone's prayer will cover for yours hehehehe ain't that funny</div></div><hr />
