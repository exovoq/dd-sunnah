(CNSNews.com) ñ Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said Sunday on NBCís ìMeet the Pressî that ìIran is a natural allyî of the U.S.<br />
ìAs long as Iran is ruled by the ayatollah and bases itself on its sectarian philosophy, we have to be careful. But basically, as a country, Iran is a natural ally of the United States. It's the ideological, religious component that makes it an antagonist,î said Kissinger, who served as Secretary of State for the Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford ********************istrations.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In his 2002 State of the Union address, President George W. Bush called Iran, Iraq and North Korea an ìaxis of evil.î<br />
<br />
ìIran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelected few repress the Iranian peopleís hope for freedom,î Bush said.<br />
<br />
ìStates like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world,î he said. ìBy seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be catastrophic.î<br />
<br />
NBCís Tom Brokaw pointed out on ìMeet the Pressî that Israel is the United Statesí ìclosest ally in the Middle Eastî and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ìdoes not pass up an opportunity to declare Iran a kind of evil empire. Heís terrified about their nuclear capacity.î<br />
<br />
Former Secretary of State James Baker suggested it was possible that Iran could become more involved in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). He said Iran is opposed to what ISIS is doing.<br />
<br />
ìI wouldnít be at all surprised if Iran was not helping us quietly deal with some of this,î said Baker, who served in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush ********************istrations.<br />
<br />
He expressed optimism about the United Statesí ability to handle ISIS, adding that the nation has come up against ìgreater challengesî in the past.<br />
<br />
ìI think we will find a way, hopefully, that we can relate to Russia so that Russia becomes once again a part of the community of nations. And so Iím optimistic. I think the United States of America has faced far greater challenges in the past than we face today,î said Baker.<br />
