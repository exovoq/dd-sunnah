LOL , not just that, but they have the nerve to try to cast doubts on our narrations, again I say, they TRY, which shows you that instead of looking for evidences then forming a belief based on those evidences, they already have a certain belief, then they try to look for evidence to support that belief,which is why their position is so weak, huge difference between the two ways of thinking!</div></div><hr />
