&quot;You are hiding like a malformed foetus in a womb; you have ran home like those who are guilty of being untrustworthy and after having destroyed the strongest men on earth you have been overcome by these wimps.&quot;Haqqul Yaqeen 203<br />
This is their so-called love of the prophets family, the type of love that makes them lie about them and describe them with the most horrible things, we seek refuge to Allah from these lies.<br />
Baqir also writes: <br />
<br />
After hearing some women talking about Ali (R.A.) Fatima (R.A.) complained about her husband's features:<br />
<br />
&quot;He is a man with a big stomach. His hands are high and his bones look suppressed. He has a receding hair line, big eyes and shows his teeth all the time. He has no wealth either. (Jilalul Uyoon: 58, in the chapter on Fatima)<br />
<br />
The very same  Baqir comments about a dream that Fatima had and establishes that the devil came to her: <br />
<br />
'The dream Fatima had was from a devil whose name is Uhaad. (Ibid: 52)<br />
<br />
Baqir narrates Fatima's displeasure with regards to Ali's attitude about her in the words of Ali:<br />
&quot;Jibreel came to the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) and said &quot;Allah sends His Salaam upon you and says that Fatima is about to come and complain about Ali. Do not listen to anything about Ali from Fatima.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Fatima came, the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) asked her if she came to complain about Ali. She replied that she had. The Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wasallam) said: &quot;By the Lord of the Ka'bah! Go back to Ali and tell him that you are prepared to rub your nose in dust in order to keep him happy. You may do as you please.&quot; (Jailul 'Uyoon: 61)<br />
<br />
The renowned Shi'ite scholar Abu Mansur Ahmed Tibrisi writes: <br />
<br />
'Abu Bakr sent Qunfudh to Ali with a delegation who entered Ali's house without his permission. Ali went for his sword but the group had already taken it away. They captured Ali and tied a rope round his neck. When Fatima tried to intervene, Qunfudh hit her. The delegation dragged Ali to Abu Bakr where Omar, Khalid bin Walid and Abu Ubaidah ibn Jarrah (R.A.) were also present with many other people. Omar severely reprimanded Ali and told him to swear allegiance with Abu Bakr. Ali then took Abu Bakr's hand and took an oath of allegiance. (Al-Ihtijaj, by Tibrisi: 83, 84)<br />
<br />
One day they hes the most brave and then the next day they describe Ali raa like this, as if he were a coward and the rest of the companions were so evil that horns are about to grow on their heads! The way they put things, couldnt ever convince any logical ( not emotional ) mind, even if it were supported by evidence, so how could one accept this if theres no supporting evidence whatsoever? <br />
How could Ali raa and the Muslims not stop this in the strongest form, how could he allow this to happen to himself, happen to Fatimah raa,happen to his honer, then give the pledge of alligance to all of the Khaleefas after Abu Bakr raa, let Omar raa marry his daughter, mention them with good, then have his offspring named after them? I seek refuge to Allah from these lies and distortionsand from the senseless minds that accept this</div></div><hr />
