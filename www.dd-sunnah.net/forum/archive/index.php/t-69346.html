ABU AMEENAH BILAL PHILIPS<br />
<br />
<br />
THE RELIGION OF ISLAM<br />
 <br />
<br />
          The first thing that one should know and clearly understand about the Islam is what the word ìIslamî itself means.  The religion of Islam is not named after a person as in the case of Christianity which was named after Jesus Christ,   Buddhism after Gotama Buddha,  Conficianism after Confucius,  and Marxism after Karl Marx.  Nor was it named after a tribe like Judaism after the tribe Judah and Hinduism after the Hindus.  Islam is the true religion of ìAllahî and as such , its name represents the central principle of Allahís ìGodísî religion ;  the total submission to the will of Allah ìGodî.  The Arabic word ìIslamî means the submission of surrender of oneís will to the only true God worthy of worship ìAllahî and anyone who does so is termed a ìMuslimî.  The word also  implies ìpeaceî which is the natural consequence of total submission to the will of Allah.  Hence, it was not a new religion brought by  Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) 1 in Arabia in the seventh century, but only the true religion of Allah re-expressed in its final form.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          Islam is the religion which was given to Adam, the first man and the first prophet of Allah, and it was the religion of all the prophets sent by Allah to mankind.  The name of Godís religion, Islam, was not decided upon by later generations of man.  It was chosen by Allah Himself and clearly mentioned in His final revelation to man.  In the final book of divine revelation,  the Quaíaan,  Allah states the following:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          ìthis day heve I perfected your religion for you completed My favour upon  you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religionî.<br />
<br />
          <br />
<br />
ìif anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah (God) never will it be accepted to  Himî (Soorah Aalíimraan 3:85)<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          ìAbraham was not a Jew nor yet a Christian; but an upright Muslimî (Soorah aalíimraan 3:67)<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          Nowhere in the Bible will you find Allah saying to Prophet Mosesí people or their descendants that their religion is Judaism, nor to the followers of Christ that their religion is Christianity.  In fact,  christ was not even his name, nor was it Jesus!  The name  ìChristî comes from the Greek word Christos which means the annointed.  That is,  Christ is a Greek translation of the Hebrew title ìMessiahî.  The name ìJesusî on the other hand, is a latinized version of the Hebrew name Esau.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          For simplicityís sake, I will however continue to refer to Prophet Esau (PBUH) as Jesus.  As for his religion, it was what he called his followers to.  Like the prophets before him, he called the people to surrender their will to the will of Allah; (which is Islam) and he warned them to stay away from the false gods of human imagination.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          According to the New Testament, he taught his followers to pray as follows:  ìYours will be done on earth as it is in Heavenî.<br />
<br />
 <br />
THE MESSAGE OF ISLAM<br />
 <br />
<br />
          Since the total submission of oneís will to allah represents the essence of worship, the basic message of Allahís divine religion, Islam is the worship of Allah alone and the avoidance of worship directed to any person , place or thing other than Allah.  Since everything other than Allah, the creator of all things, is allahís creation; it may be said that islam, in essence calls man away from the worsip of creation and invites him to worship only its Creator.  He is the only one deserving manís worship as it is only by His will that prayers are answered.  If  man prays to a tree which answered his prayers but Allah who allowed the circumstances prayed for to take place.  One might say, ìThat is obvious,î however,  to tree-worshippers it might not be.  Similarly, prayers to Jesus, Buddha, or Krishna, to Saint Christopher, or Saint Jude or even to Muhammad (PBUH) , are not answered by them but are answered by Allah.   Jesus did not tell his followers to worship him but to worship Allah.  As the Quríaan states:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          ìAnd behold Allah will sayî  ìO Jesus the son of Mary!  Did you say to man, Worship me and my mother as gods besides Allah?î  He will say :  ìGlory to you I could never say what I had no right (to sayí)î<br />
<br />
(Soorah al-Maaíidah-5:116)<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          Nor did he worship himself  when he worshipped but rather he worshipped allah.  This basic principle is enshrined in the opening chapter of the Quríaan, known as Soorah Al-Faatihah, verse4:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          ìYou alone do we worhip and from you alone do we seek helpî.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          Elsewhere, in the final book of revelation, the Quríaan, Allah also said:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          ìAnd your Lord says:îcall on Me and I will answer your (prayer). î(Soorah muímin 40;60)<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          It is worth noting that the basic message of Islam is that allah and His creation are distinctly different entities.  Neither is Allah His creation or a part of it, no is His craton Him or a part of him.<br />
<br />
          <br />
<br />
          This might seem obvious, but, manís worship of creation instead of the Crator is to a large degree based on ignorance of this concept.  It is the belief that the essence of Allah is everywhere in His creation or that His divine deing is or was present in some aspects of His creation, which has provided justification for the worship of allah through his creation.  However, the message of Islam as brought by the prophets of allah is to worship only Allah and to avoid the worship of  his creation either directly or indirectly.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
In the Quríaan allah clearly states:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          ì for we assuredly sent amongest every prople a prophet,(with the command) worship me and avoid false godsî(soorah Al-Nahi 16:36)<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          When the idol worshipper is questioned as to why he or she bows down to idols created by men, the invariable reply is that they are not actually worshipping the stone image, but Allah who is present within it.  They claim that the stone idol is only a focal point for allahís essence and is not in itself Allah!  One who has accepted the concept of the presence of Godís being within His creation in any way will be obliged to accept this argument of idolatry.  Whereas, one who understands the basic message of Islam and is implications would never concede to idolatry no matter how it is retinalized.  Those who have claimed divinity for themselves down through the ages have often based their claims on the mistaken belief that allah is present in man.  They merly had to assert that althrough Allah according to their false beliefs, is in all of uw. He is more present in them than in the rest of us.  Hence, the claim, we should submit our will to them and worship them as they are either god in person or god concentrated within the person.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          Similarly , those who have asserted the godhood of others after their passing have found fertile ground among those who accept the false belief of godís presence in man.  One who has grasped the basic message of Islam and its implications could never agree to wordhip another hman being under any circumstances. Godís religion in essence is a clear call to the wordhip of the Creator and the rejection of craton-worship in any form.  This is the meaning of the motto of Islam:<br />
<br />
                   ìLaa Elaaha lllallaahî<br />
<br />
                   (There is no god but Allah)<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          Its repetition automatically brings one within the fold of Islam and sincere belief in it guarantees one Paradise.  Thus, the fina Prophet of Islam is reported to have said.î Any one who says: There is no god but allah and dies hlding that(belief) will enter paradiseî.(Reported by Abu Dhar and collected by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim).<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          It consisits in the submission to Allah as one God, yeilding to Him by obeying his commandments, and the denial of polytheism and polytheists.<br />
<br />
 <br />
THE MESSAGE OF FALSE RELIGION<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          There are so many sects, cults, religions, philosphies, and movements in the world, all of which claim to be the right way or the only true path to Allah.  How can one determine which one is correct or if, in fact, all are correct?  The method by which the answer can be found is to clear away the superficial differnces in the teachings of the various claimants  to the ultimate truth, and identify the central object of worsip to which they call, directly or indirectly.  False  religions all have in common one basic concept with regards to Allah.  They either claim that all mer are gods or that specific men were Allah or that nature is Alah or that Allah is a figment of mainís imagination.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          Thus , it may ne stated that the basic message of false religion is that allah may be worshipped in the form of His creation.  False religion invites man to the worship of creation by calling the creation or some aspect of it god.  For example, prophet Jesus invited his followers to worship allah but those who claim to be his followers today call people to worsip Jesus, claiming that he was Allah!<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          Buddha was a reformer who introduced a number of humanistic principles to the religion of India.  He did not claim to be God nor did he suggest to his followers that he be an object  of worship.  Yet, today most Buddhists who are to be found outside India have taken him to be god and prostrate to idols made in their perception of his likeness.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          By using the principle of identifying the object of worship, false religion becomes very obvious and the contrived nature of their origin clear.  As God said in the Quríaan:<br />
<br />
          That which you worship besides Him are o nly names you and your forefathers have invented for which Allah has sent down no authority;  The command belongs only to allah:<br />
<br />
          He has commanded that you only worship Him; that is the right religion, but most men do not understandî<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          It may be argued that all religious teach good things so why should it matter which one we follow.  The reply is that all false religions teach the greatest evil, the worship of creation.  Creation ñworship is the greatest sin that man can commit because it contradicts the very purpose of his creaton.  Man was created to worship Allah alone as Allah has explicitly stated in the Quríaan:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          ìI have only created Jlnns and men, that they may worship meî(soorah Zaareeyaat)51:56<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          consequently, the worship of creation, which is the essence of idolatry, is the only unforgivable sin.  One who dies in this stae of idolar=try has sealed hos fate in the nenxt life.  This is not an opinion, but a revealed fact stated by Allah in his final revelation to man:<br />
<br />
          ìVerily allah will nor forgive the jining of partners with Him, but he may forgive (sins) less than that for whomesoever He wishesî(Soorah An-Nissa 4:48 and 1160)<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 THE UNIVERSITY OF ISLAM<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
          Since the consequences of  false religion are so grave, the true religion of Allah must be universally understandable and attainable, not confined to any people, place or time.  There can not be conditions like baptism., bellief in a man, as a saviour etc., for a a believer to enter paradise.  Within the central principle of Islam and in its definition.  (the surrender of  oneís will to God) lies the roots of  Islamís universality.  Whenever man comes to the realization that Allah is one and distinct from His creation, and submits himself to Allah, he becomes a Muslim in body and spirit and is eligible for paradise.  Thus, anyone at anytime in the most remote region of the world can become a Muslim, a follower of Godís religion, Islam, by merely rejecting the worship fo creation and by turning to Allah (God) alone.  It should be noted however, that the recognition of and submisssion to Allah requires that one chooses between right and wrong and such a choice implies accountability.   Man will be held responsible for his choices, and, as such, he should try his utmost to do good and avoid evil.  The ultimate good being the wrship of Allah alone and the ultimate evil being the worship of His creation along with or instead of Allah.  This fact is expressed int the final revelation as follows:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
ìVerily those who believe, those who believe, those who follow the Jewish(************************ures), the Christians and the Sabians any who believe in Allah and the last day, and work righteousness shall have their  Lord;  They will not be overcome by fear nor griefî<br />
<br />
(Soorah Al-Bagarah 2:62).<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
ìIf only they had stood by the law, the Gospel, and all the revelation that was sent to them from their Lord, they would have enjoyed happiness from every side.  There is from among them a party on the right course;  but many of them follow a course that is evil.î (Soorah Al-Maaíidah 5:66)<br />
