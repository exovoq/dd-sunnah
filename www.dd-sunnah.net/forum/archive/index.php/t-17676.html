i'll mention the five pillars of Islam with evidences from The Holy Quraan<br />
<br />
Islam is built up on five <br />
<br />
 Shahada:-  it is the  declaration of faith, it means there is no god except God and Muhammad is the messenger of God, Allah Talaa says in surah AlHajj ayah 62 &quot; That is because Allah, He is the Reality: and those besides Him whom they invoke, they are but vain Falsehood: verily Allah is He, Most High, Most Great&quot;.<br />
<br />
 Prayer:- called in arabic Salat is the name for the obligatory prayers which are performed five times a day, and are direct link between the worshipper and God,  Allah Talla says in surah AlBaqrah ayah 45 &quot; Nay, seek (Allah's) help with patient perseverance and prayer: it is indeed hard, except to those who bring a lowly spirit &quot;.<br />
<br />
 The Zakat:- one of the most important principles of Islam is that all things belong to God, and that wealth is therefore held by human beings in trust. it creates good communication between wealthy people and poor people, Allah Talaa says in surah AlBaqrah ayah 43 &quot; And be steadfast in prayer; practise regular charity; and bow down your heads with those who bow down (in worship) &quot;.<br />
<br />
 The fast:- called in arabic sawm, every year in the month of Ramadan, all Muslims fast from first light until sundown. Those who are sick, elderly, or on o journey, and women who are pregnant or nursing are permitted to break the fast and make up an equal number of days later in the year, Allah says in surah AlBaqrah ayah 183 &quot; O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you, that ye may (learn) self-restraint &quot;, and Allah Talaa says ayah 185 in the same surah &quot; Ramadan is the (month) in which was sent down the Qur-an, as a guide to mankind, also Clear (Signs) for guidance and judgment (between right and wrong). So every one of you who is present (at his home) during that month should spend it in fasting, but if any one is ill, or on a journey, the prescribed period (should be made up) by days later. Allah intends every facility for you; He does not want to put you to difficulties. (He wants you) to complete the prescribed period, and to glorify Him in that He has guided you; and perchance ye shall be grateful &quot;.<br />
<br />
 Pilgrimage:-  called in arabic ( Hajj ), the annual pilgrimage to Makkah- the Hajj- is an obligation only for those who are physically and financially able to perform it. Pilgrims wear special clothes: simple garments which strip away distinctions of class and culture, so that all stand equal before God, Allah Talla says in surah Alhajj ayah 27 &quot;And proclaim the Pilgrimage among men; they will come to thee on foot and (mounted) on every kind of camel, lean on account of journeys through deep and distant mountain highways &quot;.<br />
