Foreign students like Mohammed are given DVD on how to stay safe<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
03 September 2008 <br />
<br />
By Richard Morris <br />
<br />
Foreign students visiting Hastings are given a DVD advising them how to act to best avoid attack.<br />
The short films form part of a package given out to visiting youngsters by The Safer Hastings Partnership (SHP) - a collective formed by bodies such as Hastings Borough Council and the local police force.<br />
<br />
It offers practical advise to students about how to keep themselves safe and helps make them aware of laws and customs in the UK.<br />
<br />
It is one of a number of schemes operated in Hastings and St Leonards which has seen a gradual drop in the number of attacks on language students. The number of crimes committed against visiting students is now less than one per 1,000 students.<br />
<br />
In fact, the SHP has been congratulated on its work as recently as last April when the town was named one of the best destinations for foreign students by the Italian Association of Language Consultants and Agents (IALCA).<br />
<br />
David Furness, community safety manager with the SHP, was even invited to Naples and much of the SHP's work in student safety has been copied across the UK.<br />
<br />
Mr Furness said: &quot;The death of Mohammed al-Majed is extremely tragic.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sure it is little consolation to Mohammed's family that this incident is unprecedented in Hastings, but as we have said, this will strengthen our resolve to to continue to do all we can to work together to make Hastings a safe place to live, work and visit.&quot;<br />

Importance of protecting our visitors<br />
Thursday 28th August 2008<br />
<br />
In a community still reeling from the murder of a 16-year-old foreign student, questions are now being asked about the safety of visitors to Sussex. Emily-Ann Elliott looks at the reasons why students are targeted as victims of crime and the importance of making sure they are protected. <br />
<br />
Outside a takeaway shop in Hastings, a book of condolence is being filled with messages for the family of 16-year-old Mohammed Al-Majed, from Qatar, who died after being attacked by local youths. <br />
<br />
Other Arab students, many who have visited the town before to study English, express shock and distress that this could happen to a friend. <br />
<br />
Some have already said they will not return to the town as they and their families feel too frightened. <br />
<br />
Sultan Al-Dossary, from Saudi Arabia, said after hearing the news his parents wanted him to return home immediately. <br />
<br />
He said: “This is a dangerous place. I will not be coming back.” <br />
<br />
As well as being bad for the UK’s relations with other countries, these fears could have a negative effect on the economies of towns such as Hastings, where foreign students contribute up to £35 million to the local economy every year. <br />
<br />
Councillor Peter Pragnell, the leader of Hastings Borough Council, said: “Students are a vital part of our economy and we have somewhere between 30,000 and 35,000 every year. <br />
<br />
“With this figure in mind, incidents of violence against students are very, very low and we must not forget that. <br />
<br />
“Racism and violence will not be tolerated in Hastings and we will do everything in our power to prevent incidents such as this happening again. <br />
<br />
“My thoughts are with Mohammed’s family and friends at this sad time.” <br />
<br />
There are more than 20 language schools in Hastings alone and many other towns across Sussex play host to students from all over the world in the summer months. <br />
<br />
While Sussex Police has reported the number of crimes against students in Hastings is down year on year, between April 1 and August 26 this year, 30 crimes have been recorded against foreign language students. <br />
<br />
Of those, 12 were assaulted and four robbed. <br />
<br />
In 2007, 32 crimes were reported, including 13 assaults and two robberies and in 2006, there were 36 crimes, 16 assaults and five robberies. <br />
<br />
The other offences were mainly thefts. <br />
<br />
Michael Foster, MP for Hastings and Rye, said: “It’s important to say that Hastings is essentially a safe place for visitors. <br />
<br />
“Violent crime, attacks and indeed incidents involving foreign students have plummeted in recent times, which makes the tragedy involving Mohammed so exceptional. <br />
<br />
“It’s important that both visitors to our town and ethnic groups who are now living here and part of our local community feel safe and secure.” <br />
<br />
A meeting was held yesterday at Hastings Town Hall with Mr Foster, councillors, police and student leaders and representatives from ethnic groups to discuss the safety of students. <br />
<br />
Mr Foster said: “We cannot overlook the fact that foreign investment through the language schools and into the local college are significant contributors to our local economy. <br />
<br />
“It’s also the case that in recent times crime, particularly violent crime, has fallen dramatically, as have offences involving overseas students. <br />
<br />
“This weekend’s tragic incident, therefore, is out of character with the way that the town is developing.” <br />
<br />
Mohammed was murdered less than 100 yards away from Robertson Street, where a German teenager was punched and kicked in the face by a hoodie in an unprovoked attack last April. <br />
<br />
Earlier this month, two 17-year-old German students were kicked and spat at by a group of teenage girls as they walked through the Meridian Centre, Peacehaven. <br />
<br />
In July, a 17-year-old student from the Czech Republic was beaten unconscious by a group of six youths at Haywards Heath railway station. He suffered a broken ankle. <br />
<br />
In previous years, foreign students have also been targeted in Brighton, where a Chinese student was threatened at knifepoint and robbed on the beach off Madeira Drive in 2004 and a student from China was punched in the mouth when two teenagers stole her phone in 2003. <br />
<br />
Dr Alana Lentin, a senior lecturer in sociology at the University of Sussex, is an expert on racism and has written two books on the subject. <br />
<br />
She said: “This isn’t a new issue but in a place like Hastings the majority of the population has been, until recently, white. <br />
<br />
“People in Hastings have seen a big increase in people from different backgrounds moving in, whether they are migrant workers or students. <br />
<br />
“However, what I think is new is the rhetoric being bandied about against multi-culturalism. <br />
<br />
“When you hear your Prime Minister impose national values over multi-culturalism it is sending a strong message to all citizens of the UK – that anyone who doesn’t live by our rules, we have the right to be against and people feel legitimate in their actions. <br />
<br />
“This kind of overriding discourse that we shouldn’t be promoting multi-culturalism is not only coming from the bottom up. <br />
<br />
Education is one of the things needed to change this but for me the main thing that needs to change is discourse that comes down from the top. In places like Hastings what has to happen is meetings between people of different backgrounds. <br />
<br />
“On one hand you might have migrants who may not have very good English but are also fearful of a new place and on the other hand you have local people being distrustful of what is coming into their community. <br />
<br />
“Funding needs to be put in place in so they can be put in contact with each other. <br />
<br />
“As human beings they will probably have more in common than they think. Only fear comes from the unknown.” <br />
<br />
Dr Lentin added that as a result of global issues and media portrayals, people from countries such as Qatar are often viewed in a different way to those from European countries. <br />
<br />
She said: “We assume that if somebody is a young male Arab, speaking Arabic or looking a certain way, they are racially perceived as some kind of threat. <br />
<br />
“We don’t see them in the same was as we see students from, say, Spain, and we need to ask why.” <br />

UK drink culture ‘is to blame for killing’ <br />

Jailed ... thugs Sean Downes, left, and Thomas Luddington<br />

 <br />
A JUDGE yesterday blasted Britain’s booze culture as he jailed for life two thugs who threw a teenager to his death off a bridge. <br />
Thomas Luddington, 18, and Sean Downes, 19, had been drinking when they dangled Robert Gill over a river demanding his bank card PIN. <br />
<br />
They got it, then dropped the 17-year-old into the freezing water. <br />
<br />
Judge John Bevan QC said Downes and Luddington’s parents and grandparents plied them with drink as they grew up. He said: “They must have known they were liable to be aggressive in drink.” <br />
<br />
The judge also blasted pubs in their home town Bedford for serving them. <br />
<br />
<br />
Shame<br />
<br />
He said: “If they put financial gain ahead of the appalling damage they do to youngsters, in particular Robert Gill, they should feel shame.” <br />
<br />
Luddington must serve at least 18 years, Downes must do 17. Both were convicted of murder. <br />
<br />
A boy aged 15 at the time was found guilty of manslaughter and jailed for 4½ years at Luton Crown Court, Beds. <br />
<br />
He and Downes were also convicted of robbery and false imprisonment. <br />
<br />
Robert’s adoptive parents Fred and Fran, devout Christians, said they forgave the killers. <br />

RADIO DJs talk too much about booze, claimed a £22,000 study by the University of the West of England. <br />

Real LifeMy fear of cheap drink, by a judge<br />
Published: 30 Aug 2008<br />
<br />
 <br />
A JUDGE yesterday said he was afraid to go out at night for fear of violence fuelled by cheap booze – as a nearby bar cut prices. <br />
Judge Jeremy Carey had barely finished making his remarks when Jumpin’ Jaks unveiled 80p drinks. <br />
<br />
He was alarmed by the case of a man facing a wounding charge after bingeing on strong Stella lager, whisky and Sambuca “at cheap rates”. <br />
<br />
Daniel Beresford, 23, was found not guilty at Maidstone Crown Court of stabbing Andreas Fantousi in Folkestone, Kent. <br />
<br />
The judge said: “Something should be done about alcohol being bought at low prices and consumed over long periods, which leads to violence. It is the reason why you and I are fearful of being on the streets late at night.” <br />
<br />
The bar denied doing anything wrong. <br />

uk street hate <br />
<br />
When I speak to UK gangs they tell me, 'Think we're bad? You should see the ones coming up' <br />
Warning ... telly hardman Ross Kemp thinks street crime in Britain can get worse<br />
<br />

Senior Feature Writer <br />

<br />
 <br />
ROSS KEMP views the rising toll of teenage knife and gun victims in Broken Britain with ever-growing unease. <br />
The tragedy of lost young lives shocks us all. But he has witnessed the extremes gang culture can reach – and knows things can get worse. <br />
<br />
For the latest series of his acclaimed Sky One documentaries Gangs, Ross went to hotspots in Belize and LA. <br />
<br />
He also filmed much closer to home – on Merseyside.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow is the first anniversary of the shooting of Liverpool lad Rhys Jones, 11, and the trial of a teenager accused of his murder is due to start in October. <br />
<br />
Sky will not broadcast Ross’s look at the city until that trial is over, but he talked to us about the time he spent there with hoodlums involved in a vicious turf war. <br />
<br />
<br />
‘ The poverty I have seen has shocked me ’Ross Kemp<br />
<br />
“It’s the last thing I want to happen in my country, or any other, but I have seen the growing racial and economic divides around the world and in the five years I have been making programmes on gangs I have seen things getting worse. <br />
<br />
“As we head for a global recession I think it will lead to more gangs. The poverty I have seen in the UK has shocked me, while the gap between the haves and the have nots gets wider. <br />
<br />
“The reasons for gangs apply just the same all around the world: Protection, identity, influence ... and there is a massive problem here with illiteracy. <br />
<br />
“Many of the boys who join gangs have opted out of education at an early age. A teacher has to come to a decision. Does she concentrate on the two feral kids in her class or the 30 who want to learn? <br />
<br />
“It’s natural selection. So these kids will leave and wander the estates. And guess who they are going to meet on the streets – other kids like them. <br />
<br />
<br />
LA lawless ... Ross with a hoodlum in Los Angeles<br />
<br />
<br />
“Maybe the other guys will be two or three years older; they’re running for drug dealers and the next minute the kids will see these guys have mountain bikes and a few quid in their pockets. They think, ‘How much money could I make?’ <br />
<br />
“When they start making money they need to protect their territory. But they’re only 14 or 15, so they need a weapon . . .” <br />
<br />
“It’s the same in El Salvador or Belize as it is in London, Liverpool, Birmingham or wherever. <br />
<br />
<br />
“If you live to 23 in the tougher streets of Los Angeles that’s a success story. I don’t want to see that situation develop in my own country – but it is happening. <br />
<br />
“Every time I go to interview gang members in the UK they say, ‘You think we are bad? You should see the ones coming up!’ Apparently gun crime is down, but people doing the crime are getting younger and younger. <br />
<br />
“One thing about the people I have met, they are bright human beings. All those young lads in Liverpool have some potential. But when you see it knocked out of them from the ways the cards are dealt, it can be very upsetting.” <br />
<br />
<br />
Epitaph<br />
<br />
And from Merseyside to LA and beyond, Ross admits: “I have grown to like some of the people I have interviewed. <br />
<br />
“I don’t condone them. How could I? But if you spend a month with these people. . . you don’t get the interviews from them unless you join in, share a drink with them, spend time earning their trust. Whatever my own feelings about what they do, it’s not my job to judge them. All I can show to the audience is what the camera sees. <br />
<br />
<br />
“A lot of gangsters see being interviewed as a way of writing their own epitaph. These people live very short lives. <br />
<br />
“It’s up to the individual viewer to come to his or her own conclusion.” <br />
<br />
But Ross said he had seen good work being done, including the Staysafe scheme in Liverpool. This involves police and council staff targeting kids on the streets who they think are in danger and taking them to be interviewed by social workers before returning them home. <br />
<br />
Ross, 44, the son of a police officer, was shocked by the hatred of the cops from youngsters in the city. He said: “With that kind of reaction for authority we have a long way to go.” <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Street heat ... Liverpool gang members show Ross Kemp their fearsome weapons<br />
<br />
Ross has also been to Belize to film and he said what he found there was a great advertisement for NOT joining gangs. <br />
<br />
The former British colony in central America has been flooded with drugs and guns by smugglers. <br />
<br />
He said “We went on a police raid of a corrugated ****************l house in a slum. <br />
<br />
“The police were looking to find a gun on a guy whose younger brother had been shot by gang rivals two years ago and was in a wheelchair. <br />
<br />
“This young lad’s legs had withered to matchsticks and he had a colostomy bag which was full. <br />
<br />
“His flesh was septic where the tube went through his skin. <br />
<br />
“He had a hole in his upper leg through which you could see the bone. His brother helped me turn him over and his backside had gone! He was rotting from MRSA. <br />
<br />
<br />
“He told me, ‘I used to cry every day for two years but now I don’t feel any more pain. If you think guns are cool, go and smell him.’ <br />
<br />
“Knives are no different. If you carry and use a knife it is no different from pulling the trigger of a gun at close quarters. <br />
<br />
“The repercussions are the same. You will kill someone and ruin your own life at the same time. It’s hard to get that through to people when they are young.<br />
<br />
<br />
Telly hardman talks to The Sun ... Ross with Sun man Martin Phillips<br />
<br />
<br />
“But people who are caught carrying a knife should get a custodial sentence. What other deterrent do you have?” <br />
<br />
Yet Ross added: “It is rare that prison rehabilitates. <br />
<br />
“Being in prison only reaffirms the fact that you are not part of the normal structure of society, so when these kids come out they turn to gangs for support.” <br />
<br />
Ross reserves his wrath for the manufacturers of imitation guns indistinguishable from the real thing, the people who convert replica guns to fire bullets and the people selling military-style hunting knives. <br />
<br />
“They are dealing in other people’s misery,” he said. <br />
<br />
“They are as culpable as the person who pulls the knife or pulls the trigger. <br />
<br />
“These are the people who should be in jail.” <br />

Broken Britain at its worst <br />

THUGS who took turns booting an unconscious man in the head while a girl rifled his pockets were jailed yesterday. <br />
The five savages are seen battering the defenceless victim in sickening CCTV footage. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Heartless Gemma Stafford, 18, is caught sitting astride the 27-year-old and searching him as he lies face down on the road. <br />
<br />
At one point she even turns him over to rifle through his front pockets. <br />
<br />
The victim — who cops say survived by “sheer luck” — had got into a row with the gang in Rochdale, Gtr Manchester, in March. <br />
<br />
He pretended to ring police to scare them away — but the feral mob circled him, savagely knocking him down and aiming kicks at his head. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Caged ... Gemma Stafford, Joshua McErlean, Andrew Harbourne and Stuart Shaw<br />
<br />
<br />
Stafford then searched him for cigarettes and cash while Stuart Shaw, 20, put the boot in — even taking a run-up to land one last chilling blow as his victim lay with his head in a pool of blood. <br />
<br />
When cops arrived Stafford, of Rochdale, claimed she was a bystander tending to the victim’s wounds. <br />
<br />
She later said she was too drunk to remember the attack. But when video footage emerged she admitted violent disorder and robbery and was handed 18 months at Bolton Crown Court. <br />
<br />
Shaw, of Heywood, Gtr Manchester, got four years after pleading guilty to GBH and violent disorder. <br />
<br />
<br />
The others got a total of more than nine years. Cops last night released the grim video of the drunken attack in the town centre to show the wanton violence blighting broken Britain. <br />
<br />
Detective Sgt Lee Johnson, of Rochdale CID, said the “ferocity” of the kicks was horrific. <br />
<br />
He said of the gang: “Their actions were sickening to watch and is mindless violence at its worst. <br />
<br />
“This was a vicious and unprovoked attack. <br />
<br />
“It is only by sheer luck the victim wasn’t permanently injured.” <br />
<br />
Andrew Harbourne, 20, of Burnley, Lancs, got four years after admitting violent disorder and robbery. <br />
<br />
Joshua McErlean, 19, of Rochdale, was handed four years for GBH, robbery and violent disorder. <br />
<br />
A lad of 17 got 18 months’ youth detention for similar offences. <br />

Axe yobs attack on school bus<br />
The Real American IdolAxe yobs attack on school busBy BEN ASHFORD <br />

 <br />
KIDS as young as 12 cowered in fear as teen thugs attacked their school bus — and lobbed an AXE through the window. <br />
The mob cycled up to the vehicle as it stopped at a junction and smashed it with golf clubs, a crow-bar and other makeshift weapons. <br />
<br />
As the horrified driver pulled away one crazed thug threw an axe which narrowly missed ducking pupils and crashed through the other side. <br />
<br />
One boy suffered a cut to the head and damage estimated at thousands of pounds was done. <br />
<br />
It is feared the thugs targeted the 30 pupils of top Catholic school St Ambrose College because they were “brainy kids”. <br />
<br />
George Fountain, 12, said of Thursday’s attack in Altrincham, Gtr Manchester: “They were maniacs. I was near the front and started to worry in case they got on board.” <br />
