<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunniah forever</div><div class="date">26-05-04, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has been alleged that either Muëawiyah or his son Yazid was involved in the poisoning of Sayyiduna Hasan. It is claimed that one of them persuaded one of Sayyiduna Hasanís wives to ********************ister poison to him. What is the truth of this claim?<br />
<br />
this is the answer <br />
<br />
Any claim of a historical nature must be substantiated with proof. An accusation made without providing proof is slanderous, and should accordingly be dismissed as such.<br />
<br />
But even the mere presentation of evidence is not sufficient to prove the claim. There is one very important condition that has to be met, and that is authenticity. The onus rests upon the claimant not only to provide evidence for his claim, but also to authenticate his evidence. For as long as he fails to prove its authenticity his claim is nothing more than an empty and worthless accusation.<br />
<br />
This is a general rule which applies to all historical claims, and not only those to do with alleged misdeeds of the Sahabah. Let us look, for example, at the issue of the &quot;satanic verses&quot; which was so maliciously taken advantage of by the notorious Salman Rushdie. Mr. Rushdie did not suck the incident out of his thumb; he found it in historical books. However, what he failed to do was to authenticate. Why? The reason is obvious. He had his own agenda and his own preconceived notions.<br />
<br />
Thus when someone accuses Muëawiyah or anybody else of poisoning Sayyiduna Hasan, and does not care to examine the authenticity of the evidence for his accusation for no reason other than the fact that he dislikes Muëawiyah, he is no less guilty than Salman Rushdie and his ilk. Let not your enmity for a person become your only motivation for finding him guilty.<br />
<br />
And do not ever let enmity for a people carry you away into injustice. Be just; that is closer to piety. And fear Allah. Verily Allah is aware of what you do. (al-Maíidah : 8)<br />
<br />
It is authentically narrated that when Sayyiduna Hasan lay on his deathbed, dying from poisoning, his brother, Sayyiduna Husayn came to him and asked him, &quot;Brother, tell me who is the one who poisoned you.&quot; Sayyiduna Hasan asked, &quot;Why? That you may kill him?&quot; Sayyiduna Husayn said, &quot;Yes,&quot; to which Sayyiduna Hasan responded, &quot;I will not tell you anything. If it is the one I think it is, then Allahís revenge is harsher. And if it is not he, then by Allah, no innocent person will be killed on account of me.&quot;1<br />
<br />
This authentic narration shows that even Sayyiduna Hasan was not exactly sure of the identity of the poisoner. Over and above that, he refuses to tell his own brother who he suspects. It is strange that Sayyiduna Hasan himself displayed such great caution in the matter, fearing that he might be accusing an innocent person, but that people today can blurt out, without the blink of an eye, that &quot;Muëawiyah poisoned Hasan&quot;.<br />
<br />
The greatest concern Sayyiduna Hasan had was the preservation of the Ummahís unity. It was on account of this concern that he made peace with Muëawiyah in 41AH. It was also this outstanding accomplishment of his which was predicted by his grandfather, Rasulullah r , in the well known hadith &quot;This son of mine is a sayyid, and soon the time will come when through him Allah will reconcile two great masses of Muslims.&quot; He had this concern of not causing strife in the Ummah, right upto the time of the death. It was his dearest wish to be buried with his grandfather, Rasulullah r , in the room of Sayyidah ë¬íishah, but he instructed Sayyiduna Husayn not to resort to violence in the event Banu Umayyah tried to prevent his burial there, and to bury him with his mother in Jannat al-Baqië. Sayyiduna Hasan was prepared to sacrifice the things nearest and dearest to him in order to preserve the peace and unity of the Ummah.<br />
<br />
Therefore, if it was Muëawiyah whom he suspected of having him poisoned he would rather have been expected to tell Sayyiduna Husayn something like &quot;I fear that you will cause civil war if you try to revenge yourself upon the one I suspect&quot;. In the fact that he does not allude to the prospect of disunity and sedition at all, but rather expresses fear at an innocent person being killed on account of him, we therefore have reason to see that the one whom Sayyiduna Hasan suspected of poisoning him was not Muëawiyah.<br />
<br />
Muëawiyah lived for ten more years after the passing of Sayyiduna Hasan. In all that time the valiant and fearless Sayyiduna Husayn was alive, and so was his brother, Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, his cousins ëAbdullah ibn Jaëfar and ëAbdullah ibn ëAbbas, and numerous other members of the Ahl al-Bayt. However, not a single one of them ever confronted Muëawiyah on the poisoning of Sayyiduna Hasan. In fact, they maintained cordial relations with him, especially Ibn ëAbbas and ëAbdullah ibn Jaëfar. They never uttered a word about Muëawiyahís alleged involvement in the death of Sayyiduna Hasan, neither in public nor to their closest followers. This gives us so much more reason to dismiss the allegation against Muëawiyah as unfounded.<br />
<br />
Now let us look at the material in the books of history on the basis of which the allegation is made. The only report in which Muëawiyah is implicated in the death of Sayyiduna Hasan is narrated by the historian, Muhammad ibn ëUmar al-Waqidi. This report appears as follows:<br />
<br />
[Al-Waqidi] says: I heard some people saying that Muëawiyah secretly made one of his servants ********************ister poison to him.2<br />
<br />
As a report of history, this narration suffers from two fatally serious defects. The first is the universally recognised untrustworthiness of al-Waqidi. Details of his unreliability as a narrator would probably fill several pages, but all of it may be suitably condensed into a statement by Imam ash-Shafiëi, who was his contemporary, and who knew him personally. Ash-Shafiëi has the following to say: &quot;In Madinah there were seven people who used to forge chains of narration. One of them was al-Waqidi.&quot;3<br />
<br />
The second defect is much more glaring. Note that al-Waqidi does not mention the names of his informants, and that he merely says &quot;I heard some people say&quot;. This particular report comes after a number of other reports in which al-Waqidi clearly mentions the names of his informants. When he comes to this one, he merely says &quot;I heard some people say&quot;. Is it on the basis of such flimsy evidence that people today are bold enough to level an accusation of murder? Indeed, this smacks of a total disregard for academic integrity for the sake of nothing but personal sentiments and prejudice.<br />
<br />
There is another report in which the wife of Sayyiduna Hasan, namely Jaëdah bint al-Ashëath, is implicated in his murder by poisoning. This report has it that it was Yazid ibn Muëawiyah who set her up to do it, promising to marry her thereafter. This report is narrated by Muhammad ibn Salam al-Jumahi. It is reproduced by al-Mizzi in Tahdhib al-Kamal as follows:<br />
<br />
Muhammad ibn Salam al-Jumahi narrates on the authority of Ibn Juëdubah that Jaëdah, the daughter of Ashëath ibn Qays, was the wife of Hasan ibn ëAli. A message was sent to her in secret by Yazid, telling her, &quot;Poison Hasan, and I will be your husband.&quot; So she did it. When Hasan died she sent a message to Yazid asking him to fulfil his pledge. But he told her, &quot;By Allah, we didnít approve of you as Hasanís wife. Shall we approve of you as our own wife?&quot;4<br />
<br />
This is the way the report is found in the history books. To the uncritical reader who has no knowledge of the criteria of authenticity and their application, it might well appear to be acceptable evidence. To the one whose emotions have already caused him to be favourably disposed towards Sayyiduna Hasan, and unfavourably disposed towards Yazid, it is nothing less than incontrovertible evidence. But the true scholar never lets emotion make his decision for him. He first weighs the evidence, examines it and scrutinises it, and only if it merits approval and acceptance will he accept it. To the discerning scholar, emotions are shaped by evidence, and not evidence by emotions.<br />
<br />
Now we return to the report under discussion. Ibn Juëdubah, who is Muhammad ibn Salamís source for this report, is properly known as Yazid ibn ëIyad ibn Juëdubah. He lived in Madinah during the time of Imam Malik. Imam Malikís student, ëAbd ar-Rahman ibn al-Qasim, once asked his opinion about a person called Ibn Samëan. The Imam replied, &quot;He is a liar.&quot; Ibn al-Qasim then asked, &quot;And Ibn Juëdubah?&quot; Imam Malik replied, &quot;An even bigger liar, an even bigger liar.&quot;5 All other rijal critics who ever expressed themselves on his status as a narrator have concurred with Imam Malik in some way or the other.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Ibn Juëdubah died in the days of the ëAbbasid khalifah, al-Mahdi, whose reign came to an end in 169 AH. If we assume that that he died in 165 AH, and that he lived a life of 70 years, we could say he was born in about 95 AH. In other words, by the time of his birth, almost a half a century had passed after the death of Sayyiduna Hasan. The &quot;Yazid-Jaëdah plot&quot; therefore either came to his knowledge through sources whom he refrains to mention, or it was the product of his own mendacious and fertile imagination. In light of what his contemporaries thought of him (Ahmad ibn Salih al-Misri, for example says of him &quot;I think he used to invent hadith for the people.&quot;6) one is inclined to believe that the whole plot was of his own invention. Looking at the times in which he livedó the early ëAbbasid periodó , we find more reason to believe that the report is a forgery by Ibn Juëdubah. During the early ëAbbasid times sentiments were running high against the recently ousted Umayyads, and a person like the notorious Yazid would have been the perfect scapegoat.<br />
<br />
To come back now to the alleged involvement of Jaëdah bint Ashëath: There is one other report which implicates her in the poisoning of Sayyiduna Hasan, but it does not mention anything about Yazid.7 It is narrated from Umm Musa, who was a bondswoman of Sayyiduna ëAli.8 The chain of narration up to Umm Musa is reliable. However, we might pose a question here with regard to Umm Musa herself: Did she identify Jaëdah as the culprit out of knowledge of her guilt, or must her words here be construed as the emotional outburst of a bereaved woman who simply must find someone to blame for the cause of her bereavement?<br />
<br />
We do not pose this question out unnecessary skepticism. There are two things which prompt us to ask it: Firstly, Sayyiduna Hasanís own reluctance to name the person he suspected. Keep in mind also that he himself merely suspected, and did not know it for a fact. Secondly, if there were reasonable grounds for suspecting Jaëdah bint Ashëath, no man would readily marry her, especially a man of the Ahl al-Bayt. But with Jaëdah we find that after the demise of Sayyiduna Hasan she was married by his fatherís cousin Sayyiduna ëAbdullah ibn ëAbbas, and that she bore him a son, Muhammad, and a daughter, Quraybah.9<br />
<br />
From the above discussion we may then draw the following conclusions:<br />
<br />
The report implicating Muëawiyah is narrated by an extremely unreliable narratoró al-Waqidió from unnamed people<br />
<br />
The report implicating Yazid and Jaëdah are narrated by a known liaró Ibn Juëdubahó who was born almost 50 years after the incident and names no sources at all. His report comes into circulation during the early ëAbbasid period in which anti-Umayyad sentiments, and more particularly anti-Yazid sentiments, are common.<br />
<br />
The report from Umm Musa which implicates Jaëdah is more likely the emotional outburst of a bereaved woman than an allegation based on factual knowledge.<br />
<br />
Sayyiduna Hasan himself refused to disclose the identity of the one he suspected. He restrained his brother Sayyiduna Husayn from taking any action.<br />
<br />
After the death of Sayyiduna Husayn the Ahl al-Bayt maintain good relations with Muëawiyah in Damascus.<br />
<br />
In light of the above we fully endorse the statement by Ibn Kathir that none of these reports is authentic.10 We hope that this demonstrationó of how the words of a bereaved woman, a report by unknown reporters, and a forgery by a known liar came to be regarded as factual historyó will bring to light the need of critically examining historical sources before levelling accusations against anybody.<br />
